## 1. Patent Identification
- Patent Number: CN113975546A
- Application Number: 202111415885.8
- Application Date: 2021.11.25
- Publication Date: 2022.01.28
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd.
- Inventor: Zhang Ming
- Title: Syringe Body and Syringe

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem:**
Existing syringes with separable injection heads have inadequate engagement between the drug-containing cavity and the end cap. The end cap can be easily disengaged, creating a safety risk. Specifically, users may remove the end cap before the injection head is properly locked to the syringe body. Since injection requires high pressure to eject liquid, the injection head may be ejected along with the high pressure, failing to achieve injection and potentially injuring the user.

**Deficiencies of Prior Art:**
- Weak connection between end cap and injection head body
- No mechanism to prevent premature end cap removal
- Safety hazards during high-pressure injection operations

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Prevents end cap removal when injection head is not properly locked to syringe body
- Improves operational safety
- Prevents loss of injection head assembly parts
- More hygienic operation

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The core invention is a sequential locking mechanism for a syringe system that controls when the end cap can be removed from the injection head. The syringe body constrains the end cap and injection head body to remain together until the injection head assembly reaches a locked position relative to the syringe body. This is achieved through:

1. **Positional Control**: The outer shell's internal diameter is designed to contact the end cap's outer surface when the injection head is inserted but not rotated to the locked position, preventing the end cap from deforming radially and thus maintaining engagement with the injection head body.

2. **Staged Release**: Once the injection head assembly is rotated to the locked position, a radial gap forms between the outer shell and end cap, allowing the end cap to deform and separate from the injection head body.

3. **Rotational Locking**: The injection head assembly inserts axially into a first transition position, then rotates in an installation direction to reach the locked position. The system prevents continued proximal movement at the first transition position but allows distal movement.

The technical effect is eliminating the risk of premature end cap removal and preventing ejection of a loosely-connected injection head during high-pressure injection operations.

## 4. Independent Claims

### Claim 1: Syringe Body (Device)
- **Breadth**: Broad
- **Type**: Device/Apparatus
- **Scope**: Covers the syringe body configured to work with an injection head assembly, including outer shell, internal pusher, and the locking mechanism that controls end cap separation

### Claim 16: Syringe (System)
- **Breadth**: Broad
- **Type**: System
- **Scope**: Covers the complete syringe system including both the syringe body (from Claim 1) and the injection head assembly with its components

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Analysis:**

### Mandatory Technical Elements:

**Element A (Structural)**: Syringe body (100) for use with injection head assembly (200)
- Function: Houses the injection mechanism and accepts the injection head assembly

**Element B (Structural)**: Injection head assembly comprises separable injection head body (210) and end cap (230)
- Function: Provides the injection interface with removable protective cap

**Element C (Structural)**: Syringe body includes outer shell (110) and internal pusher (120) axially movable relative to outer shell
- Function: Provides housing and actuation mechanism

**Element D (Structural/Functional)**: Distal opening allowing injection head assembly insertion to locking position
- Function: Entry point and mechanical interface for injection head assembly

**Element E (Functional)**: When injection head assembly inserted to distal opening but not at locking position → syringe body prevents axial separation of end cap and injection head body
- Function: Safety constraint preventing premature end cap removal

**Element F (Functional)**: When injection head assembly at locking position → syringe body prevents axial displacement between injection head body and outer shell AND allows axial separation of end cap and injection head body
- Function: Locks injection head while enabling end cap removal

### Functional Language:
- "configured to": Used throughout to describe the syringe body's designed behaviors
- "allows": Describes permissive function (allowing insertion, separation)
- "prevents"/"阻止": Describes restrictive function (preventing separation, displacement)
- "being constructed as"/"被构造为": Indicates intentional design to achieve specified functions

### Structural vs Functional Assessment:
**Structural elements**: Outer shell, internal pusher, distal opening, injection head assembly components
**Functional elements**: Preventing separation mechanism, allowing separation mechanism, positional sensing/control
**Hybrid**: The claim combines structural components (shells, pushers) with functional limitations (prevents/allows based on position). The "how" of preventing/allowing is not fully specified in Claim 1, making it broader but potentially more vulnerable to design-around.

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
1. **Position-dependent locking mechanism**: Syringe body that changes behavior based on whether injection head assembly has reached locking position
2. **Dual-mode operation**:
   - Mode 1 (unlocked): Prevents end cap/injection head body separation
   - Mode 2 (locked): Prevents injection head/outer shell displacement, allows end cap removal
3. **Structural components**: Outer shell, internal pusher, distal opening
4. **Rotational locking**: Injection head assembly rotates from first transition position to locking position (Claims 3, 6, 7)
5. **Radial gap mechanism**: Inner diameter control to constrain/allow end cap deformation (Claim 3)
6. **Elastic member**: Compressed by injection head assembly, provides resistance (Claim 4)

### Implicitly Covered
1. **Any mechanism** that prevents end cap separation before locking, regardless of specific implementation (functional claiming)
2. **Various configurations** of protrusions/grooves that achieve the locking positions
3. **Different materials** for elastic members or deformable components
4. **Equivalent rotational angles** or positions for achieving locking
5. **Automated or manual actuation** of the internal pusher (electric, pneumatic, spring-driven per Claim 15)
6. **Multi-stage engagement systems** (first transition, second transition, locked positions per Claims 6-7)

### Disclosed but Not Claimed
1. **Specific angles of rotation** for locking (not numerically defined)
2. **Specific materials** for components
3. **Viewing window design**: Specific configuration of hollow portions (124) and transparent portions (113) for observing medicine bottle (Claims 12-13) - this is claimed but quite specific
4. **Torque values**: First predetermined torque vs second predetermined torque for different coupling mechanisms (Claims 8, 28)
5. **Specific shapes** of protrusions, flanges, grooves shown in figures
6. **Direction indicator marking** (234) on end cap
7. **Needle-free vs needled configurations**: Disclosure mentions both but doesn't claim protection for switching between modes

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

### Literal Infringement Risk: **HIGH**

**Justification:**
Any competing syringe system with a removable injection head that prevents end cap removal until proper locking would literally infringe. The claim language is broad and functional, covering the "what" (preventing separation until locked) rather than the "how."

**Function**: Prevent premature end cap removal / Enable end cap removal after locking
- Same function: Any safety mechanism serving this purpose matches

**Way**: Position-dependent constraint changing behavior
- Same way: Using positional sensing (rotational, axial, or other) to switch between constrained and free states would infringe
- Different way only if: Achieving the result through time-based, electronic sensing, or completely non-mechanical means

**Result**: Safe operation with no risk of loose injection head during high-pressure injection
- Same result: Protecting against ejection of incompletely attached injection head

### Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: **MEDIUM to HIGH**

**Potential Equivalents:**
1. **Linear locking instead of rotational**: Pushing straight in multiple stages with position clicks - likely equivalent (same function/result, insubstantially different way)
2. **Electronic sensing**: Sensor detecting proper seating and mechanically/electronically preventing end cap removal - potentially equivalent
3. **Magnetic locking**: Using magnets to hold end cap until injection head is magnetically locked to body - potentially equivalent
4. **Different constraint mechanism**: Instead of radial constraint of end cap, using axial locks, detents, or other physical barriers - likely equivalent if serving same function

**Prosecution History**: Would need to review to determine if certain alternatives were disclaimed during examination.

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

### Strategy 1: Eliminate Sequential Dependency
**Approach**: Design an injection head assembly where the end cap can always be removed freely, but the injection head cannot be attached to the syringe body unless the end cap is already removed. This reverses the sequence - instead of preventing end cap removal until locked, prevent attachment until end cap is removed.

**Technical Implementation**:
- End cap dimensions that would interfere with insertion into syringe body distal opening
- Requires user to remove end cap first, then insert bare injection head
- Injection head locks directly to syringe body in one step

**Avoids infringement**: Does not "prevent axial separation of end cap and injection head body" based on locking position, as they separate before any locking occurs.

### Strategy 2: Permanent End Cap Replacement
**Approach**: Replace the removable end cap with a permanent sterile barrier that automatically opens/breaks upon complete locking, or use a sliding/rotating shield rather than a separable cap.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Sliding sleeve that retracts when injection head reaches locked position
- Frangible seal that breaks during locking rotation
- Iris-type closure that opens at locked position
- Hinged cap that swings away rather than separates axially

**Avoids infringement**: No "axial separation" of components occurs; the protection mechanism moves or breaks rather than separates.

### Strategy 3: User-Independent Locking Detection
**Approach**: Use a clear visual, tactile, or audible indicator of proper locking that doesn't mechanically prevent end cap removal, coupled with a one-way end cap removal mechanism (can't be re-attached once removed).

**Technical Implementation**:
- Color-change indicator when locked (mechanical or chemical)
- Audible click at locked position
- Tactile detent that user can feel
- End cap designed to destroy itself upon removal (break-away tabs)
- One-time-use end cap prevents reattachment to incompletely locked head

**Avoids infringement**: Does not use the syringe body to "prevent" end cap separation; instead relies on user detection of proper locking state and destruction of end cap to prevent reuse on improperly locked head. This is weaker protection but may avoid literal infringement of the "prevents...separation" limitation.

### Strategy 4: Integrated Non-Separable Design
**Approach**: Design the injection head body and end cap as a single integrated component that doesn't separate at all. The sterile barrier is internal or uses a different mechanism.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Injection head with internal valve that opens when locked
- No removable end cap; entire injection head is disposable
- Sterilization maintains integrity without removable cap

**Avoids infringement**: No separable end cap and injection head body relationship exists.

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe

1. **Traditional fixed-needle syringes** without detachable injection heads - fundamentally different product architecture

2. **Pre-filled syringes** where the drug is pre-loaded and sealed, with no user-replaceable injection head assembly

3. **Cartridge-based injection systems** where medication cartridges are separate from the injection mechanism and loaded differently

4. **Single-piece molded injection heads** with non-removable caps or no caps

5. **Bayonet-mount systems with simultaneous engagement** where a single 90-degree rotation both locks the injection head AND releases the end cap in one motion (no intermediate state)

6. **End-cap-first removal designs** (Strategy 1) where dimensional interference prevents attachment with cap on

7. **Break-away or hinged caps** (Strategy 2) that don't separate axially

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area

1. **Multi-stage locking with different mechanism** - If using linear click-stops or other non-rotational locking, may still infringe under DOE if serves same function
   - Monitor: Whether function/result are identical despite different way

2. **Electronic locking systems** - Using sensors and electronic locks may be deemed equivalent
   - Monitor: Patent owner's arguments about purely mechanical vs. electromechanical scope

3. **Magnetic or friction-based constraint** - Using magnets or friction to hold end cap until locking could be equivalent
   - Monitor: Claim construction of "prevents" - does it require physical blocking or include other retention?

4. **Time-delay mechanisms** - Requiring a minimum time before end cap can be removed
   - Monitor: Whether "position-based" prevention is construed to include time-based

5. **Partial coverage designs** - If end cap only partially covers injection head, may argue different structure
   - Monitor: Claim scope of "end cap" definition

### ❌ High-Risk / Must Avoid

1. **Any rotational locking system** where end cap cannot be removed until injection head rotates to locked position - this is the core claimed configuration

2. **Radial constraint mechanisms** where outer shell inner diameter controls end cap deformation - explicitly claimed in Claim 3

3. **Elastic member compressed by injection head** that provides resistance - explicitly claimed in Claim 4

4. **First and second transition positions** with specific engagement/disengagement sequence - explicitly claimed in Claims 6-7

5. **Torque-differentiated coupling systems** - explicitly claimed in Claims 8, 28

6. **Circumferential protrusion and groove systems** for locking - explicitly claimed in Claims 5, 25

7. **Piston rod engagement/disengagement during rotation** - explicitly claimed in Claims 7-11, 27-33

3. **Two elastic members**: Can use 1, 3, or more

4. **Specific wing plate configuration** (Claims 32-33): Can use different shapes or numbers of radial protrusions
