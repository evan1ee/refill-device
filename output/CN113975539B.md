## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

The patent addresses the operational complexity in conventional injectors where different parts of the injection head assembly must be separately engaged with different parts of the injector body, requiring complicated manual user intervention.

**Deficiencies of Prior Art:**
- Injection head assembly components must be individually engaged with corresponding injector body components
- The engagement process is complex and typically requires manual user operation
- Users must manually unlock the piston rod component from the injection head body before removal
- Risk of incomplete or incorrect engagement during installation
- Potential for component loss during disassembly

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Automated unlocking mechanism that uses rotational engagement to trigger disengagement
- Simplified installation and removal process requiring only rotation, not manual manipulation of individual components
- Sequential engagement system ensures proper assembly order
- End cap remains attached until locked position is reached, preventing premature removal
- Entire injection head assembly can be removed as a single unit, preventing component loss
- Improved safety and operational convenience

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention introduces an injection head assembly with a sequential rotational engagement system that automatically manages the coupling and uncoupling of multiple components during installation and removal. The system uses three key positions: a first transition position (initial insertion), a second transition position (where the piston rod component locks to the internal pusher), and a locked position (where the injection head body locks to the external housing).

The key inventive contribution is the automated unlocking mechanism: when the injection head body continues rotating in the installation direction from the second transition position, the piston rod component automatically disengages from the injection head body while remaining locked to the internal pusher. This eliminates the need for users to manually unlock these components. Additionally, the end cap is constrained from separating from the injection head body until the locked position is reached, and elastic elements provide rotational resistance when the end cap is removed at the locked position, preventing unintended reverse rotation.

The primary technical effect is operational simplification and safety improvement—the entire installation and removal process is managed through rotational movements without requiring users to manually engage or disengage individual internal components, while preventing incomplete assembly or component loss.

## 4. Independent Claims

- **Claim 1**: Device (injection head assembly for injector body), Broad
- **Claim 7**: Device (injector body for injection head assembly), Broad
- **Claim 11**: System (injector including injector body and injection head assembly), Broad

Note: The patent contains 17 total claims, with multiple dependent claims adding specific structural features for the engagement mechanisms, locking structures, elastic elements, safety features, and visual windows.

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 (Broadest Independent Claim):**

- **Element A**: An injection head assembly for use with an injector body, where the injector body has a distal opening and includes an external housing (110) and an internal pusher (120) located within the external housing and axially movable relative to the external housing

- **Element B**: The injection head assembly includes:
  - An injection head body (210) having a proximally-open cavity (210c) therein
  - A piston rod component (220) having a piston rod extending distally, the piston rod component disposed proximally of the injection head body such that the piston rod can extend into the cavity

- **Element C**: The injection head assembly is configured to be capable of:
  - Inserting from outside the injector body into the distal opening of the injector body to reach a first transition position
  - Rotating from the first transition position in an installation rotation direction to a second transition position
  - Continuing to rotate in the installation rotation direction to a locked position

- **Element D**: The injection head assembly is configured such that:
  - At the second transition position, the piston rod component and the internal pusher lock together, and when the injection head body continues rotating in the installation rotation direction, the piston rod component and the injection head body disengage
  - At the locked position, the injection head body is locked to the external housing

**Functional Language:**
- "is configured to be capable of" (被构造为能够) - used extensively for describing component functions
- "lock together" (锁定) - functional locking without specifying mechanism
- "disengage" (脱离接合) - functional separation without structural detail
- "continuing to rotate" (继续旋转) - functional sequential operation
- "axially movable" (轴向可移动) - functional movement capability

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
- Elements A and B are hybrid structural-functional (name specific components but define relationships functionally)
- Element C is predominantly functional (describes capability and movement sequence without specifying mechanisms)
- Element D is entirely functional (describes what happens at different positions, not how it's achieved structurally)
- The terms "lock together" and "disengage" are functional without limiting to specific locking/unlocking mechanisms
- The sequential rotation process (first transition → second transition → locked position) is functionally defined
- The claim allows various mechanical implementations (cams, grooves, protrusions, sliding mechanisms) as long as they achieve the specified functional sequence

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
- Injection head assembly comprising injection head body and piston rod component
- Sequential rotational installation through three positions (first transition, second transition, locked)
- Automatic locking of piston rod component to internal pusher at second transition position
- Automatic disengagement of piston rod component from injection head body upon continued rotation
- Locking of injection head body to external housing at locked position
- Rotational installation and removal process
- The overall injector system incorporating these features

### Implicitly Covered
- Various mechanical locking mechanisms (detents, cams, grooves with protrusions, interference features, bayonet-style locks)
- Different rotational angles between positions (as long as sequential progression is maintained)
- Various spring or elastic element configurations for providing rotational resistance
- Different geometric shapes for engagement features (hooks, teeth, tabs, slots)
- Multiple materials for components (plastics, metals, composites)
- Different actuation force requirements for rotation
- Various elastic element placements and orientations
- Different visual indicator designs for position status
- Multiple configurations of end cap attachment to injection head body

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

- **Literal Infringement Risk**: **High**
- **Doctrine of Equivalents Risk**: **High**

**Justification:**

- **Function**: Any competing injection head assembly that simplifies installation/removal by using rotational movement to automatically manage engagement and disengagement of internal components performs the same function—allowing users to install and remove the injection head without manually manipulating individual component connections. This operational convenience is highly desirable and competitors would naturally seek similar solutions.

- **Way**: The claimed approach uses sequential rotational positions with automated locking and unlocking triggered by continued rotation. This is defined very broadly and functionally. The claim covers virtually any mechanism that achieves: (1) insertion to a first position, (2) rotation to a second position where internal components lock together, (3) continued rotation causing automatic disengagement of some components while maintaining other engagements, and (4) final locking at a locked position. Even substantially different mechanical implementations (different cam profiles, alternative groove geometries, magnetic coupling, spring-loaded mechanisms) could fall within literal scope or equivalents if they achieve these functional steps.

- **Result**: The result is identical for any effective implementation—a simplified installation process where users only need to insert and rotate the injection head assembly, with automatic internal component engagement/disengagement managed by the rotational movement itself. The final result is a properly locked assembly ready for use, and removal reverses the process by rotating in the opposite direction.

**Additional Risk Factors:**
- The broadest claim (Claim 1) uses extensively functional language ("configured to," "capable of," "lock together," "disengage") without structural limitations on how these functions are achieved
- The sequential rotation concept with automatic unlocking is claimed very broadly without limiting to specific mechanical structures
- The patent comes from Beijing Kuaishu'er Medical Technology, which has a systematic portfolio of injection-related patents
- Recent grant date (2023.10.20) indicates examination under current standards
- Multiple independent claims cover the injection head assembly, injector body, and complete injector system from different angles
- The automation of component engagement/disengagement is the key commercial advantage that competitors would want to replicate

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

### Strategy 1: Eliminate Automated Sequential Rotation—Use Manual Component Engagement
Design an injection head assembly where users must manually perform separate operations to engage the piston rod component with the internal pusher and to lock the injection head body to the external housing, rather than having these occur automatically through sequential rotation.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifically requires that the injection head assembly is "configured to" reach a first transition position, rotate to a second transition position where locking occurs, and continue rotating to a locked position with automatic disengagement occurring during this process. A design requiring separate manual actions for each engagement (e.g., push-in-and-twist for one component, then a separate locking action for another) would not achieve the claimed sequential rotational automation. While this sacrifices operational convenience, it avoids the claimed invention.

**Implementation**: Require users to first manually engage the piston rod component with the internal pusher using a push-and-click mechanism, then separately rotate and lock the injection head body to the external housing using a threaded connection or separate locking collar.

### Strategy 2: Use Linear (Axial) Installation Without Rotation
Implement an installation system where the injection head assembly is inserted axially without rotation, using spring-loaded latches, magnetic coupling, or bayonet-lock mechanisms that engage through purely axial movement rather than rotational movement.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 requires rotation "from the first transition position in an installation rotation direction to a second transition position" and continued rotation "in the installation rotation direction to a locked position." A purely axial installation that achieves locking through linear movement (push to engage, with automatic latching) rather than rotation would not meet the claimed rotational installation sequence. While equivalents arguments might apply, there is a structural distinction in the motion type.

**Implementation**:
- Spring-loaded latches that automatically engage when the injection head assembly is pushed to a fully inserted position
- Magnetic alignment and holding that secures components through axial insertion
- Snap-fit engagement features activated by linear push forces
- Quick-release buttons that unlock axial retention rather than rotational locks

### Strategy 3: Reverse the Sequence—Lock Injection Head Body First, Then Piston Rod Component
Design a system where rotation first locks the injection head body to the external housing, and only after this locking is complete does further rotation (or a separate action) engage the piston rod component with the internal pusher.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifies a particular sequence: at the second transition position, the piston rod component and internal pusher lock together, and upon continued rotation, the piston rod component and injection head body disengage while the injection head body locks to the external housing at the locked position. By reversing this sequence (locking injection head body first, then engaging piston rod component), the design would not literally meet the claimed sequential progression. However, this strategy carries moderate equivalents risk as it achieves a similar overall result through reversed sequencing.

**Implementation**: Design rotational engagement features such that the first rotational phase locks the injection head body to the external housing, and a second rotational phase (or separate push-rotate action) then engages the piston rod component with the internal pusher.

### Strategy 4: Eliminate the Second Transition Position—Use Simultaneous Engagement
Design a system where all component engagements (piston rod to internal pusher, injection head body to external housing) occur simultaneously at a single locking position, without an intermediate second transition position where only partial engagement exists.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifically requires distinct positions: a first transition position, a second transition position (where piston rod component and internal pusher lock but injection head body is not yet locked to external housing), and a locked position. A design that achieves all locking functions simultaneously in one operation would not have the claimed second transition position as an intermediate state. This eliminates the claimed sequential automatic unlocking feature.

**Implementation**: Use cam features or engagement profiles designed so that insertion and rotation to a single locked position causes all components to engage together, without intermediate partial-engagement states.

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe:
- Conventional injection head assemblies requiring manual disassembly of individual components (unscrew injection head body, manually pull piston rod from internal pusher)
- Purely threaded connections for both injection head body and piston rod component without automatic unlocking features
- Systems requiring tool-based installation and removal (hex keys, special wrenches) rather than hand rotation
- Injection head assemblies with permanent non-removable connections between components
- Press-fit or interference-fit assemblies without rotational installation mechanisms
- Designs where all components lock simultaneously in a single action without sequential positions
- Purely axial push-lock systems with spring-loaded latches and no rotational movement

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area:
- Rotational installation systems with different sequencing (e.g., injection head locks before piston rod engages)—may face equivalents arguments despite reversed sequence
- Partial rotation combined with axial movement (helical motion)—borderline on whether this constitutes the claimed rotational installation
- Systems with only two positions (insertion and locked) rather than three distinct positions—depends on whether courts view this as eliminating the "second transition position" element
- Quick-release mechanisms using rotation but without the specific sequential locking/unlocking automation—depends on claim interpretation breadth
- Electronic actuation triggered by rotational position sensors—different mechanism but achieves similar automatic engagement result
- Magnetic rotational alignment that provides position resistance without mechanical locking—may not meet "lock together" requirement but could face equivalents arguments

### ❌ Must Avoid:
- Any rotational installation system with sequential positions where initial rotation locks piston rod component to internal pusher, and continued rotation automatically unlocks piston rod component from injection head body
- Three-position rotational systems (first transition, second transition, locked) matching the claimed sequence
- Automated component disengagement triggered by continued rotation in the installation direction
- Designs explicitly described as having "first transition position," "second transition position," and "locked position" in product documentation
- Systems marketed as "automatic unlocking" or "sequential rotational engagement" for injection head assemblies
- Implementing any of the specific mechanical structures shown in the patent drawings (exact cam profiles, groove geometries, protrusion shapes)
- End cap constraint mechanisms that prevent end cap removal until locked position is reached combined with elastic elements providing rotational resistance
- Using wing plates on piston rod mounting base interacting with circumferential blocks on internal pusher to achieve the claimed sequential engagement/disengagement

### Follow-up Patent Potential: **Yes**

The patent claims the basic sequential rotational engagement mechanism broadly but leaves substantial room for improvement patents:

**High-Value Follow-On Areas:**

1. **Smart Installation Verification**: Electronic systems using sensors, RFID, or NFC tags to verify correct installation sequence completion, with data logging for compliance tracking. Current patent does not claim electronic verification.

2. **Haptic Feedback Systems**: Advanced tactile feedback mechanisms providing distinct haptic signatures at each transition position, including variable resistance profiles or vibration patterns. Goes beyond simple elastic element resistance.

7. **Single-Handed Operation Aids**: Ergonomic features specifically enabling complete installation and removal using only one hand, valuable for healthcare providers managing multiple tasks.

8. **Child-Safety Rotational Locks**: Mechanisms requiring specific multi-step rotational sequences (e.g., rotate, press, rotate) to prevent child access while maintaining clinical usability.

9. **Damage Detection Integration**: Structural health monitoring features detecting cracks, deformation, or wear in engagement components during rotation, preventing use of damaged assemblies.

10. **Modular Sequential Systems**: Interchangeable injection head assemblies with different functional modules (various needle types, dose capacities) all using compatible sequential rotational engagement with the same injector body.

**Strategy Note**: While the base sequential rotational engagement mechanism is broadly claimed, specific user experience enhancements, safety features, electronic integration, and clinical workflow improvements remain available for patenting. Focus on features that address real-world clinical challenges such as installation errors, user training, contamination prevention, and accessibility for users with varying physical capabilities.
