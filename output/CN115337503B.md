# Patent Analysis — CN115337503B

## 1. Patent Identification
- Patent Number: CN115337503B
- Title: Needleless Injector (无针注射器)
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd.
- Application Date: 2022.09.07
- Grant Date: 2023.11.10

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem Addressed:**
- Prior art needleless injectors require tedious multi-step operations: (1) install drug tube to injector, (2) extract medicine from storage vial using needle on drug tube, (3) separate drug tube from vial, then (4) perform injection
- This process is cumbersome, time-consuming, and inefficient
- Particularly problematic in emergency situations requiring rapid drug delivery

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Enables fast injection with only 2 user operations (remove safety device, press operating device)
- Pre-filled drug storage eliminates need for separate drug extraction
- Improves injection efficiency and saves time in critical situations
- Simplifies operation sequence

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The core innovation is a **pre-filled needleless injector** that integrates drug storage and injection chambers with a safety interlock system. The device features:

1. A **pre-filled drug storage chamber** that eliminates the need for manual drug extraction
2. A **safety device** positioned between the storage and injection chambers that prevents accidental drug transfer
3. An **operating device** that, when pressed after safety removal, performs two sequential actions:
   - First, transfers drug from storage chamber to injection chamber
   - Second, triggers high-pressure piston movement to expel drug through injection micropore

The key inventive contribution is the **sequential two-stage actuation mechanism** that enables rapid injection through simple user actions, transforming a complex multi-step procedure into a streamlined two-step process.

## 4. Independent Claims

**Claim 1:** Device claim - Needleless injector with storage component, injection component, safety device, and actuation component (Broad)

The patent contains 41 dependent claims but only 1 independent claim, indicating a pioneering broad base claim with extensive variation coverage.

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Elements:**

- **Element A:** Drug storage component (102) comprising storage chamber shell (114) forming a storage chamber pre-filled with drug liquid

- **Element B:** Injection component (101) comprising:
  - Injection chamber shell (104) forming injection chamber with injection micropore (106) at front end
  - Piston assembly (105) movably disposed in injection chamber

- **Element C:** Safety device (120) operably positioned between storage chamber and injection chamber, configured to enable communication between chambers when operated

- **Element D:** Actuation component comprising operating device (128) configured to:
  - Move toward injection micropore direction after safety device operation to transfer drug from storage to injection chamber
  - Trigger piston assembly (105) movement upon reaching predetermined position
  - Cause drug ejection through injection micropore (106)

**Functional Language:**
- "configured to enable communication" - functional
- "able to move" - functional capability
- "can trigger" - functional result
- "pre-filled" - structural state

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
The claim combines structural elements (chambers, shells, micropore, piston) with functional limitations (triggering sequence, drug transfer, communication enabling). The functional language defines the operational relationship between components rather than specific mechanical structures, providing broad coverage across multiple implementation variants.

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
- Pre-filled drug storage chamber configuration
- Safety device positioned between storage and injection chambers enabling selective communication
- Operating device that performs sequential actions: drug transfer followed by piston triggering
- Piston assembly with internal passageway for drug flow
- Movable storage component between initial and activated positions
- Injection micropore for drug delivery

### Implicitly Covered
- Various safety device removal mechanisms (pull-out, rotational, combined motion)
- Different transmission systems converting operating device linear motion to piston reverse motion (gear/rack, pulley/belt, chain/sprocket)
- Multiple actuation mechanisms (screw-thread rotation, spring-driven, compressed gas)
- Locking mechanisms preventing premature piston release
- Needle penetration structure for piercing storage chamber seal

### Disclosed but Not Claimed
- Specific gear ratios and thread pitches for transmission components
- Bearing arrangements for rotational components
- Specific dimensional relationships between storage and injection chamber cross-sections
- Ball-type locking elements in particular groove configurations
- Detailed insertion slot geometries for safety device
- Specific materials for elastic components

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: High**

A competing pre-filled needleless injector with safety interlock would likely contain all claim elements:
- Most pre-filled designs require some storage chamber (Element A)
- Needleless injection requires piston-driven pressure chamber (Element B)
- Safety features are standard practice, typically positioned between storage and delivery (Element C)
- Sequential actuation (transfer then inject) is the logical operational sequence (Element D)

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: High**

**Function-Way-Result Analysis:**
- **Function:** Enable rapid injection from pre-filled storage by sequentially transferring drug then triggering high-pressure ejection while preventing accidental activation
- **Way:** Safety device removal allows storage-injection communication; operating device motion both transfers drug and triggers piston at predetermined position
- **Result:** Simplified two-step user operation (remove safety, press) replacing complex multi-step extraction procedure

**Equivalents that pose risk:**
- Alternative safety mechanisms (sliding covers, rotary locks, button releases) perform same function
- Different mechanical transmissions (cable/pulley, hydraulic, pneumatic) achieve sequential triggering
- Variations in piston release timing mechanisms still achieve same two-stage result

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**Strategy 1: Eliminate Pre-filled Configuration**
- Use traditional fillable chamber requiring manual drug loading before each use
- Breaks Element A (pre-filled drug storage requirement)
- User must extract drug from vial into chamber as separate step
- **Trade-off:** Returns to the multi-step process; loses primary benefit of the invention

**Strategy 2: Eliminate Safety Interlock Between Chambers**
- Design with direct permanent connection between storage and injection chambers
- Storage chamber empties into injection chamber during manufacturing/assembly
- Breaks Element C (operably positioned safety device between chambers)
- **Trade-off:** Requires different storage approach; potential shelf-life and sterility concerns

**Strategy 3: Simultaneous Rather Than Sequential Actuation**
- Design where drug transfer and piston ejection occur simultaneously with single continuous motion
- Operating device does not "trigger" piston at "predetermined position" but rather drives both actions at once
- Breaks Element D's sequential two-stage triggering requirement
- **Trade-off:** May reduce injection pressure control; potentially less efficient drug delivery

**Strategy 4: Reverse Motion Direction**
- Operating device moves away from injection micropore (rearward) to trigger injection
- Storage component moves forward to injection chamber rather than piston moving rearward
- Breaks Element D's directional requirement ("toward injection micropore")
- **Trade-off:** Less intuitive user operation; mechanical complexity

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe
- **Traditional needleless injectors** with separate drug extraction step using needle from external vial
- **Non-pre-filled systems** where user manually fills chamber immediately before injection
- **Single-chamber designs** without separated storage and injection chambers
- **Reusable systems** where drug is loaded per use rather than pre-filled during manufacturing
- **Spring-loaded designs** without the specific operating device triggering mechanism

### ⚠ Conditional/Watch Area
- **Pre-filled cartridges** that attach to reusable injector body (depends on whether safety device is "between" chambers)
- **Different trigger sequences** where piston activation precedes or occurs simultaneously with drug transfer
- **Gravity-fed or pressure-differential systems** without mechanical operating device
- **External safety mechanisms** not positioned between storage and injection chambers (e.g., trigger locks, cap safety)
- **Alternative sequential mechanisms** using different predetermined position detection methods

### ❌ High-Risk/Must Avoid
- **Pre-filled dual-chamber** designs with storage and injection separated during storage
- **Safety device positioned between chambers** preventing communication until removed/operated
- **Operating device moving toward injection end** that sequentially (1) enables drug transfer then (2) triggers piston
- **Two-step user operation** involving safety removal followed by operating device actuation
- **Piston assembly with internal passageway** allowing drug flow before injection

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity

### Unclaimed Reusable Features

- **Pulley/belt transmission** (Embodiment 3) as alternative to gear/rack
- **Chain/sprocket transmission** (mentioned but not detailed)
- **Bearing support structures** for rotational components (thrust bearing between supports)
- **Specific locking ball mechanisms** in radial grooves for locking/unlocking
- **Dimensional ratios** between storage and injection chamber cross-sections determining transfer efficiency
- **Dual spring system** (first elastic element for storage advancement, second spring for injection drive)

### Improvement Opportunities
