## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

The patent addresses the complexity and operational challenges in conventional needleless injectors where medicine must be loaded into the injection chamber before each use, requiring multiple user steps and increasing the risk of contamination or dosing errors.

**Deficiencies of Prior Art:**
- Conventional needleless injectors require users to draw medicine from external vials or ampoules
- Manual medicine loading is time-consuming and requires multiple operational steps
- Risk of air bubbles entering the injection chamber during loading
- Potential for contamination during medicine transfer
- Dosing accuracy depends on user skill
- Multiple handling steps increase operational complexity

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Pre-filled medicine storage eliminates manual loading steps
- Disposable design ensures sterility and prevents cross-contamination
- Automatic medicine transfer from storage to injection chamber
- Simplified operation requiring fewer user actions
- Consistent dosing due to pre-measured medicine volumes
- Movable storage component allows compact initial configuration
- Safety device prevents premature activation

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention introduces a disposable needleless injector with an integrated pre-filled medicine storage chamber that physically moves to connect with the injection chamber during device preparation. Unlike conventional designs where medicine is manually loaded, this system comes pre-filled from the manufacturer and uses mechanical movement of the entire storage component to establish fluid connection with the injection chamber.

The key inventive contribution is the movable storage component architecture that transitions between an initial position (where storage and injection chambers are disconnected) and an activation position (where they are fluidly connected). This movement is combined with an elastic actuation mechanism that automatically drives medicine transfer once connection is established, eliminating manual medicine loading entirely.

The primary technical effect is operational simplification for disposable single-use applications—users simply activate the connection mechanism and the pre-loaded medicine automatically transfers to the injection chamber, ready for administration. This reduces preparation steps, ensures sterile medicine delivery, and provides consistent dosing.

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 (Broadest Independent Claim):**

- **Element A**: An injection assembly (101) comprising an injection chamber housing (104) that forms an injection chamber

- **Element B**: A medicine storage component (102), wherein the medicine storage component is movably disposed relative to the injection assembly, the medicine storage component comprising:
  - A storage chamber housing (114) forming a storage chamber, wherein the storage chamber is capable of communicating with the injection chamber, and the storage chamber is pre-filled with medicine liquid
  - A plunger (115) movably disposed in the storage chamber
  - A delivery pusher (116) movably disposed in the storage chamber, wherein the delivery pusher is capable of being actuated to push the plunger (115) in a first direction toward the injection chamber

- **Element C**: An actuation assembly (103), wherein the actuation assembly comprises an actuation device (127), the actuation device (127) is configured to be capable of actuating the delivery pusher (116) in a predetermined state after the storage chamber and injection chamber are in communication, the actuation device includes an elastic element (252), the elastic element is capable of acting on the delivery pusher along the first direction

- **Element D**: Wherein the medicine storage component (102) has an initial position and an activation position, and is capable of moving between the initial position and the activation position

**Functional Language:**
- "is configured to be capable of" (被构造为能够) - used to describe actuation device function
- "capable of communicating" (能够连通) - functional capability for fluid connection
- "capable of being actuated" (能够被致动) - functional actuation capability
- "is capable of moving" (能够移动) - functional movement capability
- "pre-filled with medicine liquid" (预充有药液) - functional state description
- "in a predetermined state after" (在...之后的预定状态下) - conditional functional operation

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
- Elements A and B are hybrid structural-functional (name specific components but define relationships functionally)
- Element C is predominantly functional (describes what the actuation device does and its conditional operation)
- Element D is entirely functional (describes capability and positions, not structure)
- The term "capable of communicating" leaves the specific connection mechanism undefined
- "Pre-filled" is a state description, not a structural limitation on how filling occurs
- "Movably disposed" is functional (describes capability) without specifying the movement mechanism
- The elastic element is structural (named component) but its function ("capable of acting along first direction") is broadly defined
- The claim allows various implementations of movable connection, actuation mechanisms, and elastic elements as long as the functional relationships are achieved

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

- **Literal Infringement Risk**: **High**
- **Doctrine of Equivalents Risk**: **High**

**Justification:**

- **Function**: Any competing disposable needleless injector that simplifies medicine preparation by pre-filling medicine in a storage component and establishing automatic connection to an injection chamber performs the same function—eliminating manual medicine loading steps and ensuring sterile, pre-measured dosing. This is a primary market advantage that competitors would naturally seek to replicate.

- **Way**: The claimed approach uses a "movable medicine storage component" that transitions between positions to establish communication with the injection chamber, combined with an elastic element that drives medicine transfer. This is defined functionally with minimal structural constraints. The claim covers virtually any mechanism allowing storage component movement (linear slides, rotational pivots, snap connections, threaded engagement) combined with any elastic actuation (springs of various types, elastic bands, compressed gas). Even substantially different mechanical implementations achieving movable connection would likely fall within literal scope or equivalents.

- **Result**: The result is identical for any effective implementation—medicine is pre-filled in a storage chamber that begins disconnected from the injection chamber, the storage component moves to establish fluid communication, and elastic energy automatically drives medicine transfer into the injection chamber. Any design achieving this operational sequence produces the same user experience and clinical result.

**Additional Risk Factors:**
- The broadest claim (Claim 1) uses extensively functional language ("capable of," "configured to") without structural limitations
- Pre-filled disposable format is highly commercially desirable, increasing likelihood competitors will attempt similar designs
- The movable connection concept is defined by function (establishing communication) rather than specific structural means
- Elastic actuation is claimed broadly without limitation to specific spring types or actuation mechanisms
- The patent comes from Beijing Kuaishu'er Medical Technology, which has a portfolio of related needleless injector patents suggesting systematic IP strategy
- Recent grant date (2024.04.02) indicates examination under current standards
- Dependent claims add features but do not eliminate broad independent claim risk

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

### Strategy 1: Eliminate Movable Storage Component—Use Permanently Connected Chambers
Design a disposable needleless injector where the medicine storage chamber and injection chamber are permanently fluidly connected from the time of manufacturing, with a valve or septum controlling medicine flow rather than physical movement of the storage component to establish connection.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifically requires that the medicine storage component "has an initial position and an activation position, and is capable of moving between the initial position and the activation position." A design with permanently connected chambers (where storage and injection are always in fluid communication, controlled only by a valve) lacks the movable storage component element. While this may sacrifice some packaging compactness, it clearly avoids the claimed moving component architecture.

**Implementation**: Pre-fill a storage chamber that is permanently attached to the injection chamber via a passage containing a one-way valve, burst membrane, or pierceable septum. User activation opens the valve or pierces the barrier rather than moving the entire storage component.

### Strategy 2: Use Non-Elastic Actuation for Medicine Delivery
Implement medicine transfer using mechanical leverage (cam, screw, rack-and-pinion) or user direct-push mechanisms rather than elastic element actuation, where the user manually provides the driving force for medicine transfer.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 requires an actuation device that "includes an elastic element (252), the elastic element is capable of acting on the delivery pusher along the first direction." A design using purely mechanical actuation without stored elastic energy distinguishes from this requirement. While the user must provide force, this eliminates the claimed elastic element.

**Implementation**:
- User-operated screw mechanism that advances the plunger via mechanical advantage
- Cam-operated plunger advancement where user rotation drives linear plunger motion
- Direct manual push where user force (not elastic energy) drives the delivery pusher

**Risk Note**: This strategy has moderate risk under equivalents doctrine if the court views manual mechanical actuation as equivalent to elastic actuation for achieving the same result.

### Strategy 3: Eliminate Pre-Filled Configuration—Use Traditional Manual Loading
Design a needleless injector that returns to conventional operation where the injection chamber is empty initially and users load medicine from external vials immediately before use, eliminating the pre-filled storage component entirely.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 requires a storage chamber "pre-filled with medicine liquid" as an inherent feature of the disposable device. A design where the injection chamber is loaded manually from external sources lacks the pre-filled storage component element and its movable architecture. While this sacrifices the operational convenience advantage, it clearly avoids the claimed pre-filled movable storage invention.

**Implementation**: Provide a standard needleless injector with an injection chamber that accepts medicine via syringe transfer, vial draw, or cartridge insertion immediately before each use, without any pre-filled storage component built into the device.

### Strategy 4: Use Fixed Storage with Moving Injection Chamber
Reverse the movement architecture by keeping the medicine storage chamber stationary and moving the injection chamber to connect with storage, rather than moving storage to connect with injection.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifies "a medicine storage component (102), wherein the medicine storage component is movably disposed relative to the injection assembly." If the injection assembly moves while storage remains fixed, this arguably does not meet the literal claim language requiring the storage component to be movable. While equivalents arguments may apply (relative motion), there is a structural distinction.

**Implementation**: Mount the pre-filled storage chamber in a fixed position within the device housing, and design the injection chamber assembly to translate or rotate into connection position when activated.

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe:
- Conventional needleless injectors with manual medicine loading from external vials (no pre-filled storage component)
- Pre-filled designs where storage and injection chambers are permanently connected without movable storage component
- Needleless injectors with removable/replaceable pre-filled cartridges that snap into place without moving relative to injection chamber
- Systems using burst membranes or pierceable septa for medicine transfer without component movement
- Non-elastic actuation systems (screw-driven, gear-driven, cam-operated) for plunger advancement
- Reusable multi-dose needleless injectors (not disposable single-use format)
- Systems where user manually pushes plunger without elastic element assistance

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area:
- Pre-filled designs with rotating (rather than translating) storage component connection—may still be "movable" under claim interpretation
- Elastic elements that assist but don't fully drive medicine transfer—depends on whether "capable of acting along first direction" requires complete driving force
- Storage components with minimal movement (micro-translation for sealing) during connection—borderline on "initial position and activation position" interpretation
- Magnetic coupling between chambers allowing connection without direct mechanical movement—distinguishable but may face equivalents arguments
- Pneumatic or hydraulic actuation replacing elastic elements—different energy storage medium but similar automatic actuation function
- Fixed storage with moving injection chamber—literal distinction exists but equivalents risk remains

### ❌ Must Avoid:
- Any pre-filled disposable needleless injector where a medicine storage component physically moves (slides, rotates, pivots) from a disconnected position to a connected position relative to the injection chamber
- Designs using springs, elastic bands, or other elastic elements to automatically drive medicine from storage to injection chamber after connection
- Systems explicitly marketed as "pre-filled" with "automatic medicine transfer" via "movable storage connection"
- Implementing specific embodiments shown in patent drawings (particular sliding mechanisms, spring configurations, latch designs)
- Two-position storage systems (initial/activation) with elastic-driven medicine delivery
- Any design described in technical documentation as having "movable medicine storage component" with "elastic actuation"
- Copying the specific safety device structures disclosed for preventing premature storage-injection connection
