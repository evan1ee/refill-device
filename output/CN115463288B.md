## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

The patent addresses operational complexity in conventional needleless injectors where users must manually manipulate pistons in opposite directions for different functions.

**Deficiencies of Prior Art:**
- Conventional needleless injectors require users to pull the piston away from the injection head when loading medicine
- Users must then push the piston toward the injection head when performing injection
- This two-direction manual operation is cumbersome and requires multiple steps
- The process is labor-intensive and prone to user error

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Simplifies user operation by requiring movement in only one direction
- Reduces user effort through mechanical advantage
- Provides more intuitive operation (push in one direction for both functions)
- Simple structure that is easy to manufacture and assemble
- Automatic priming of injection chamber during operation

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention introduces a motion-reversing needleless injector that uses a transmission device to convert unidirectional user input into bidirectional mechanical output. When the user presses an operating device toward the injection site (first direction), the transmission device mechanically converts this motion into retraction of the piston assembly away from the injection microhole (second direction), thereby drawing medicine into the injection chamber.

The key inventive contribution is the mechanical transmission mechanism that eliminates the need for users to perform opposing manual movements. By pushing the operating device forward, the injection plunger simultaneously moves backward to create space for medicine, and a separate actuation mechanism drives medicine from a storage chamber into the injection chamber through a passage in the piston assembly.

The primary technical effect is operational simplification—users only push in one direction throughout the entire preparation and injection cycle, making the device more user-friendly and reducing the potential for operational errors.

## 4. Independent Claims

- **Claim 1**: Device (needleless injector with motion-reversing transmission), Broad
- **Claim 2**: Device (adds housing connection between transmission and injection chamber), Medium
- **Claim 3**: Device (specifies gear-based transmission mechanism), Medium
- **Claim 4**: Device (specifies pulley and belt transmission variant), Medium
- **Claim 5**: Device (specifies chain and sprocket transmission variant), Medium

Note: The patent contains 33 claims total, with multiple dependent claims building on the independent claims by adding specific structural features, locking mechanisms, medicine storage components, and operational details.

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 (Broadest Independent Claim):**

- **Element A**: An injection assembly (101) comprising an injection chamber housing (104) that forms an injection chamber, with the housing having injection microholes (106) at the front end connecting the external environment to the injection chamber

- **Element B**: A piston assembly (105) disposed in the injection chamber, where the piston assembly is configured to be capable of moving in the injection chamber along a first direction toward the injection microhole and a second direction opposite to the first direction, and the piston assembly (105) has a passage communicating with the injection chamber

- **Element C**: An actuation assembly (103) comprising an operating device (128), where the operating device (128) is configured to be capable of moving along the first direction

- **Element D**: A transmission device (129), where the transmission device (129) is configured to be capable of converting motion of the operating device (128) along the first direction into synchronous motion of the piston assembly along the second direction in the injection chamber

**Functional Language:**
- "is configured to be capable of" (被构造为能够) - used extensively to describe component functions
- "capable of moving" (能够移动) - functional capability limitation
- "converting motion" (转换运动) - functional transformation without structural specificity
- "synchronous motion" (同步运动) - functional relationship between components

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
- Elements A, B, C are hybrid structural-functional (name components but define them partly by function)
- Element D is predominantly functional (describes what the transmission does, not specific mechanism)
- The term "transmission device" (传动装置) is broad and mechanism-agnostic
- Motion conversion is claimed functionally without limiting to specific mechanical implementations
- "Synchronous" creates a timing relationship without specifying the mechanism
- The claim allows various mechanical implementations (gears, pulleys, chains, cams, linkages) as long as they achieve the specified directional conversion

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

- Operating device movable in first direction (toward injection site)
- Transmission device that converts first-direction motion into opposite second-direction motion

- The overall needleless injector system incorporating these elements

### Implicitly Covered

- Different mechanical advantage ratios between input and output motion
- Various mounting configurations for the transmission device
- Different geometric arrangements of components

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

- **Literal Infringement Risk**: **High**
- **Doctrine of Equivalents Risk**: **High**

**Justification:**

- **Function**: Any competing needleless injector that simplifies operation by converting single-direction user input into piston retraction performs the same function—allowing users to prepare the device for injection by pushing in only one direction rather than pulling the piston backward manually. This is the core operational benefit that competitors would seek to replicate.

- **Way**: The claimed "transmission device" is defined broadly and functionally without limitation to specific mechanical structures. This language covers virtually any mechanism that reverses motion direction: gear systems, pulley and belt assemblies, chain drives, cam mechanisms, lever arrangements, rack-and-pinion systems, or even hydraulic/pneumatic linkages with mechanical output. Even substantially different mechanical implementations could fall within the literal scope or be deemed equivalent if they perform the same directional conversion function.

- **Result**: The result is identical for any effective implementation—when the operating device moves forward (first direction), the piston assembly simultaneously moves backward (second direction), creating space in the injection chamber for medicine to enter. Any design achieving this operational outcome produces the same result from the user's perspective.

**Additional Risk Factors:**
- The broadest claim (Claim 1) contains no structural limitations on the transmission mechanism beyond its functional capability
- The synchronous motion requirement is easily met by any direct mechanical linkage
- The passage through the piston assembly is a simple structural feature easily incorporated
- Dependent claims narrow the scope but do not eliminate infringement risk for the broad independent claim
- The patent comes from the same applicant as other patents in this portfolio, suggesting systematic IP strategy
- The 2024 grant date indicates recent examination under current standards

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

### Strategy 1: Eliminate Motion Reversal—Use Conventional Sequential Operation
Design a needleless injector that returns to conventional operation where the user manually pulls the piston assembly backward (away from injection microhole) to create space, then pushes forward for injection. This eliminates the transmission device entirely.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifically requires a transmission device that converts motion in the first direction to motion in the second (opposite) direction. A conventional design where the user directly controls piston position in both directions lacks this conversion mechanism. While this sacrifices the operational simplification benefit, it clearly avoids the claimed invention.

**Implementation**: Use a direct mechanical connection between a user-operable handle and the piston assembly, allowing bidirectional control without motion reversal.

### Strategy 2: Use Non-Mechanical Actuation for Piston Movement
Implement electronic, pneumatic, or hydraulic actuation to retract the piston assembly, triggered by a user control (button, switch, or sensor) rather than mechanical transmission of linear motion from an operating device.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 requires an "operating device" that moves along the first direction and a "transmission device" that converts this motion. An electronic actuation system does not mechanically transmit the motion—instead, a user input triggers a motor, solenoid, compressed gas release, or hydraulic system to move the piston independently. The absence of mechanical motion conversion distinguishes this from the claimed invention, though equivalents arguments might still apply.

**Implementation**:
- Electronic: User presses a button activating a motor or linear actuator to retract piston
- Pneumatic: User triggers compressed gas release to drive piston backward
- Hydraulic: User actuates a valve releasing hydraulic pressure to position piston

### Strategy 3: Rotational Input Instead of Linear First-Direction Motion
Design the operating device to require rotational motion (twisting) rather than linear motion along the first direction, with the rotational input converted to linear piston retraction through a screw mechanism or cam system.

**Rationale**: Claim 1 specifies that the operating device is "configured to be capable of moving along the first direction"—which is defined as the linear direction toward the injection microhole. A rotational input does not move "along" this direction but rather rotates about an axis. While a screw mechanism does convert motion, it converts rotational to linear rather than the claimed linear-to-opposite-linear conversion.

**Implementation**: User rotates a knurled collar or handle, which drives a lead screw or cam mechanism to linearly retract the piston assembly. The input motion is fundamentally different (rotational vs. linear along first direction).

**Risk Note**: This strategy has moderate risk under equivalents doctrine, as it still achieves the same result through mechanical conversion, albeit with different input motion geometry.

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe:
- Conventional needleless injectors requiring manual bidirectional piston control (pull back to fill, push forward to inject) without motion-reversing transmission
- Completely manual systems where user directly manipulates piston position in both directions
- Pre-filled single-use needleless injectors with no user-controlled medicine loading mechanism
- Needleless injectors using spring energy storage where user compresses a spring directly (not through motion-reversing transmission) and spring release drives injection
- Systems where medicine chamber and injection chamber are permanently connected without movable piston assembly
- Multi-chamber designs that use valve switching rather than piston movement for medicine transfer

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area:
- Electronic actuation systems (motor, solenoid) triggered by user input—depends on whether courts view electrical signal transmission as equivalent to mechanical transmission device
- Pneumatic or hydraulic systems with mechanical trigger—borderline on whether fluid pressure transmission constitutes a "transmission device" under equivalents
- Rotational input mechanisms (twist to retract piston)—distinguishable on input motion type but achieves similar result
- Two-stage button mechanisms where initial press unlocks and further press drives a different function—depends on specific implementation
- Magnetic coupling between operating device and piston assembly—no direct mechanical transmission but achieves synchronized motion
- Systems using stored mechanical energy (pre-compressed springs) where operating device releases rather than directly drives motion

### ❌ Must Avoid:
- Any mechanical linkage (gears, belts, chains, levers, cams, rack-and-pinion) that converts linear forward motion of an operating device into linear backward motion of a piston assembly
- Compound pulley systems or lever mechanisms achieving motion reversal
- Sliding mechanisms with reverse-angle guide surfaces converting forward input to backward output
- Pantograph or scissor linkages creating opposite-direction motion
- Any system explicitly described as using a "transmission device" or "motion converter" for directional reversal
- Designs that market the operational benefit of "push forward to prepare, push forward to inject"—strong evidence of infringement
- Implementing any of the specific embodiments shown in the patent drawings (gear trains, belt/pulley, chain/sprocket)
- Claiming "motion reversal" or "directional conversion" as a feature in marketing or documentation
