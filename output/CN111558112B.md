## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem:**
- Traditional needleless injectors require complex drug loading procedures: users must install the drug tube, draw medicine from a storage vial using a needle, separate the tube from the vial, and then perform injection
- This process is cumbersome, time-consuming, and labor-intensive
- Existing solutions that combine drug tube and storage vial are costly and fail to meet safety requirements for long-term drug contact

**Claimed Advantages:**
- The invention allows storage vials (such as cartridge bottles) to remain installed inside the needleless injector body
- Each use enables drawing medicine from the stored vial and completing injection without removing the vial or separating the drug tube from the vial
- The operation is efficient and labor-saving
- Prevents vial loss and contamination issues

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention provides a refillable needleless injection system where:

**Key Technical Concept:**
A needleless injector system comprising an injection head with an integrated drug pathway that connects to a replaceable storage vial housed permanently within the injector body. The piston rod contains an internal drug channel allowing medicine to flow from the vial into the drug-holding cavity during aspiration.

**Inventive Contribution:**
- Internal drug channel design in the piston rod enables in-situ aspiration from a stored vial
- One-way valve mechanism prevents backflow contamination
- The system allows the vial to remain installed during multiple use cycles
- Auxiliary push rod mechanism can further compress the vial space to enhance aspiration efficiency

**Primary Technical Effect:**
- Streamlined workflow: no need to remove vial or separate components between uses
- Improved hygiene and reduced contamination risk
- Cost-effective multi-dose usage from standard pharmaceutical vials
- Enhanced user convenience for chronic medication administration

## 4. Independent Claims 

**Claim 1 (Injection Head):** Device claim - **Broad**
- Type: Injection head device for needleless injector
- Scope: Defines novel injection head structure with internal drug channel in piston rod

**Claim 9 (Injector Body):** Device claim - **Medium**
- Type: Needleless injector body
- Scope: Defines body structure that accommodates the injection head and storage vial with specific locking and actuation mechanisms

**Claim 24 (Complete Injector):** System claim - **Broad**
- Type: Complete needleless injector system
- Scope: Combination of injector body (Claims 9-23) and injection head

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 - Injection Head:**

**Element A - Drug Tube (21):**
- Function: Contains rear-opening chamber and forms injection micro-hole (211) at front end
- Structure: Tubular structure with defined chamber and precision orifice

**Element B - Piston Rod (22) comprising:**
- **B1 - Piston (221):** Located in chamber, movable front-to-back, cooperates with drug tube sidewall and front wall to define drug-holding cavity (25)
- **B2 - Rod portion (222):** Fixedly connected to piston rear end

**Element C - Rear End Insertion Capability:**
- Function: Rod portion rear end can insert into storage vial and extend into vial interior during use
- Structural relationship: Creates fluid connection between external vial and internal cavity

**Element D - Drug Channel (222c):**
- Function: Internal channel connecting drug-holding cavity and storage vial
- Flow path: Enables medicine transfer from vial to cavity

**Element E - Installation Relationship:**
- Injection head and storage vial can be jointly installed on injector body
- Piston rod configured to move rearward relative to drug tube (aspiration mode)
- Piston rod configured to move forward relative to drug tube (injection mode)
- During injection, piston rod remains fixed relative to storage vial

**Functional Language:**
- "能够" (capable of/configured to) - appears multiple times describing movement capabilities
- "构造为能够" (constructed/configured to be capable of) - defines design intent for relative motion
- These functional terms allow coverage of various mechanical implementations achieving the same movement relationships

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
- Elements A, B1, B2, D are primarily structural (defined by physical components and geometry)
- Elements C and E are functional (defined by relationships and movement capabilities)
- The claim balances structural definitions with functional relationships, providing moderate breadth while maintaining definiteness
- The functional language in Element E creates potential design-around opportunities by not specifying exact mechanisms

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
- Injection head with piston rod containing internal drug channel
- Drug tube with rear-opening chamber and front injection micro-hole
- Piston movable within chamber to define drug-holding cavity
- Capability to jointly install injection head and storage vial on injector body
- Relative movement between piston rod and drug tube for aspiration and injection
- Piston rod remains fixed relative to storage vial during injection

### Implicitly Covered
- Various mechanical linkage mechanisms achieving the claimed relative movements
- Different one-way valve configurations (ball valve, cone valve, internal passage valve - shown in dependent claims but principle applies broadly)
- Different energy storage mechanisms (springs, compressed gas, etc.)
- Various locking mechanisms for holding internal pusher during aspiration
- Threading or other fastening methods for component attachment

### Disclosed but Not Claimed
- Specific spring arrangements (multiple spring shafts around internal pusher - Fig. 21)
- Specific electromagnetic locking mechanism (Claim 15 - alternative to mechanical lock)
- Transparent or hollow-out portions for visibility (Claim 23)
- Specific thread pitch or dimensional ratios
- Auxiliary medicine push rod for compressing vial space (disclosed in embodiments Fig. 22-34)
- Specific screw nut conversion mechanism for rotary-to-linear motion
- Particular button and ball-type locking structure details

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: HIGH**

**Justification:**
- **Function:** Any needleless injector designed to draw from an installed vial and inject without vial removal would perform the same drug delivery function
- **Way:** The piston-in-chamber design with internal drug channel is a logical solution; alternative pathways (external tubes, side channels) would be obvious variations but likely still infringe under doctrine of equivalents
- **Result:** Same clinical outcome - efficient refillable injection system with integrated vial storage

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: HIGH**

**Specific Risks:**
1. **Internal drug pathway variations:** Even if the channel is positioned differently (alongside piston vs. through piston center), if it connects vial to drug cavity, likely equivalent
2. **Movement mechanism variations:** Different actuators (electric motor, pneumatic, hydraulic) achieving the same relative motion would likely be deemed equivalent
3. **Vial retention methods:** Any approach keeping vial inside body during operation poses risk
4. **One-way valve alternatives:** Check valves, duckbill valves, membrane valves all achieve same backflow prevention

**Prosecution History Considerations:**
- Multiple dependent claims show patentee contemplated various implementations, suggesting broad interpretation intended
- Examiner citations (12 prior art references) indicate thorough examination, strengthening granted claims

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**Strategy 1: External Vial Connection**
- **Approach:** Position storage vial externally rather than internally, using detachable tube connection
- **Mechanism:** Quick-disconnect fluid coupling allows vial attachment/removal without permanent housing
- **Claim Avoidance:** Breaks "jointly installed" limitation and "internal housing" configuration
- **Trade-off:** Slightly less compact, but maintains refillability without literal infringement

**Strategy 2: Pre-filled Cartridge Without On-Device Aspiration**
- **Approach:** Use pre-filled cartridges that load directly into drug cavity without aspiration step
- **Mechanism:** Cartridge itself becomes the drug-holding cavity, no separate aspiration via internal channel needed
- **Claim Avoidance:** Eliminates need for internal drug channel in piston rod and aspiration movement
- **Trade-off:** Higher per-use cost but simpler mechanism

**Strategy 3: Dual-Chamber Design Without Moving Piston Relationship**
- **Approach:** Fixed piston in drug chamber, separate plunger in vial chamber, both driven forward simultaneously
- **Mechanism:** Parallel actuation rather than relative movement between piston and vial
- **Claim Avoidance:** Changes structural relationship - piston doesn't move "relative to drug tube" in aspiration mode; instead both advance together
- **Trade-off:** More complex actuation but may avoid key claim limitations

**Strategy 4: Removable Vial with Express Loading Port**
- **Approach:** Design loading port allowing vial insertion/removal without disassembly, aspiration occurs during brief connection
- **Mechanism:** Spring-loaded port cover, user inserts vial, triggers aspiration, then vial can be removed and stored separately
- **Claim Avoidance:** Vial not "jointly installed" during injection phase; system architecture fundamentally different
- **Trade-off:** Less convenient but cheaper per-dose cost using standard vials

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe:
- **Traditional separate syringe approach:** Draw medicine with separate syringe, load into injector - no integrated vial housing
- **Disposable pre-filled units:** Entire injection head is disposable with pre-loaded dose - no refill mechanism
- **External bag reservoir:** Collapsible external bag (like IV bag) connected via tube, not cartridge vial format
- **Purely manual aspiration:** User manually draws medicine into separate chamber before loading into device

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area:
- **Modular cassette systems:** If cassette contains both vial and aspiration mechanism but is user-removable between doses - depends on interpretation of "jointly installed"
- **Vial holder on device exterior:** If vial mounts externally but connects to internal pathway - may argue different "installation" but risky
- **Alternative fluid transfer methods:** Pressure differential without moving piston (e.g., vacuum aspiration) - novel mechanism but may still read on functional claim language
- **Non-standard vials:** Using flexible pouches instead of rigid vials - changes form factor but likely still covered functionally

### ❌ High-Risk / Must Avoid:
- **Any piston rod with internal channel connecting housed vial to injection chamber**
- **Vial permanently/semi-permanently housed in device body during injection**
- **Aspiration via relative piston movement while vial remains fixed in body**
- **Combined installation of injection head + vial as a unit**
- **Any one-way valve preventing backflow into vial during injection (explicitly claimed in dependent claims)**

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity

### Unclaimed Reusable Features:
1. **Specific auxiliary medicine push rod mechanism (Fig. 22-34):** System with transmission rod, nut structure, and one-way bearing for vial space compression - detailed implementation disclosed but could be separately claimed with additional features
2. **Specific multi-spring arrangement on spring shafts (Fig. 21):** Symmetrical spring distribution around central axis - specific geometry unclaimed
3. **Electromagnetic locking alternative (Claim 15):** Mentioned but not detailed - room for specific electromagnet design IP
4. **Transparent window positioning and shapes:** General concept claimed but specific designs for optimal viewing unclaimed
5. **Button-ball locking geometry:** Specific angles, profiles, and force thresholds unclaimed

### Improvement Opportunities:
1. **Dose metering mechanism:** Patent adds precise dose measurement system integrated with the aspiration mechanism

3. **Contamination detection:** Sensors detecting vial seal integrity or medicine degradation
4. **Ergonomic enhancements:** Specific grip patterns, force-feedback mechanisms, or accessibility features for patients with limited dexterity
5. **Smart connectivity:** IoT integration for dosage tracking, reminders, and compliance monitoring

### Follow-up Patent Potential: **YES - HIGH**

**Rationale:**
This patent establishes a platform technology. Multiple valuable improvements are foreseeable:
- **Mechanical refinements:** Optimized locking mechanisms, reduced component count, improved manufacturing methods
- **Material innovations:** Biocompatible coatings, anti-microbial surfaces, specialized elastomers for seals
- **Integration opportunities:** Combining with auto-injector features, dose titration, multi-drug delivery
