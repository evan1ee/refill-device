# Patent Analysis — CN113975540B

## 1. Patent Identification
- Patent Number: CN113975540B
- Grant Date: 2023.12.26
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (北京快舒尔医疗技术有限公司)
- Inventor: Zhang Ming (张明)
- Title: Injector head assembly, injector body and injector (注射头组件、注射器主体和注射器)

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem:**
- In existing injectors, after the injector head assembly is installed on the injector body and the end cap is removed, the injector head body can rotate in the unloading direction and be removed independently from the injector body
- This operation may lead to loss of the end cap
- The unloading operation may create hygiene issues since the end cap does not cover the injector head body during removal

**Prior Art Deficiencies:**
- Parts can be lost during disassembly (specifically the end cap)
- Unhygienic operation when removing components separately
- Insufficient control over the disassembly sequence

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Prevents the injector head body from rotating toward the unlocked position when correctly locked with the injector body and the end cap has been removed
- To remove the injector head body, the end cap must be reinstalled first, allowing the entire injector head assembly to be removed as a unit
- Avoids loss of injector head assembly parts
- Makes operation more hygienic
- Provides more rational engagement between piston rod component, injector head body, and injector body
- Allows engagement between piston rod and injector body to unlock the engagement between piston rod and injector head body without manual operation

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention implements a mechanical locking mechanism that controls the disassembly sequence of an injector head assembly. An elastic member (such as elastic pillars) is positioned on the distal end face of the injector body, protruding slightly above the surface. The injector head assembly consists of an injector head body and an end cap that can be separated axially.

The key innovation is that when the assembly is in the locked position, the end cap compresses the elastic member. Once the end cap is removed, the elastic member rebounds and physically blocks the injector head body from rotating in the unlocking direction. This creates a forced sequence: to disassemble, the user must first reinstall the end cap (which compresses the elastic member again), then rotate and remove the entire assembly as a unit.

Additionally, the patent describes a sophisticated engagement system between the piston rod, injector head body, and injector body using multiple coupling structure groups with different predetermined torque thresholds, enabling automatic unlocking during the installation/removal process.

The invention also includes features for observing medicine bottle capacity through viewing windows and preventing relative rotation between outer shell and inner pusher while allowing axial movement.

## 4. Independent Claims

- **Claim 1:** Injector head assembly - Device type, Broad
- **Claim 7:** Injector body - Device type, Broad
- **Claim 11:** Injector (complete system) - System type, Broad

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Analysis (Injector Head Assembly):**

**Element A - Injector Head Body (210):**
- Must have a proximally open cavity (210c)
- Must have micropores at distal end communicating between cavity and outside environment

**Element B - End Cap (230):**
- Must be mounted at the distal end of the injector head body

**Element C - Insertion and Rotation Capability:**
- Assembly must be capable of insertion into the distal opening of the injector body
- Assembly must be capable of rotation to a locked position relative to the injector body

**Element D - Elastic Member Compression:**
- When inserted into the distal opening, the assembly must be capable of compressing the elastic member on the injector body

**Element E - Locking Mechanism with Elastic Member:**
- When in locked position, the end cap compresses the elastic member
- When end cap is removed, the elastic member rebounds
- The rebounded elastic member blocks the injector head body in the rotational direction

**Functional Language:**
- "configured to be insertable" (能够插入)
- "capable of compressing" (能够压缩)
- "blocks" (阻挡)
- These terms indicate functional requirements rather than specific structural limitations

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
- Elements A and B are primarily structural (physical components with defined features)
- Elements C, D, and E are functional (describing what the assembly can do and how it behaves)
- The claim combines structural recitation with functional language, providing flexibility in implementation
- The "blocking" function is particularly important and relies on the interaction between multiple components

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed

- End cap compressing elastic member when in locked position
- Elastic member rebounding to block rotation when end cap is removed
- Circumferential flange defining engagement features (Claims 2-6)
- Multiple coupling structure groups between components
- Elastic member as elastic pillars in grooves

### Implicitly Covered
- Any mechanism that achieves the blocking function through elastic member rebound
- Various configurations of the circumferential flange (continuous or segmented)
- Different geometries of the coupling features (protrusions, grooves, steps)
- Various elastic member materials and shapes that achieve compression/rebound function
- Both needle-free and needle-based injector applications
- Alternative arm/flange configurations that create the circumferential platform

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: MEDIUM**

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: MEDIUM to HIGH**

**Justification:**

**Function Analysis:**
- Function: Prevent unintended disassembly of injector head body when end cap is removed; ensure parts are removed as a complete assembly
- The core function is mechanical blocking through elastic rebound to control disassembly sequence

**Way Analysis:**
- Way: Using an elastic member positioned on the injector body that is compressed by the end cap when assembled, and rebounds to create a physical barrier when the end cap is removed
- The specific implementation uses elastic pillars that protrude from the distal face and interact with a circumferential flange formed by the end cap and injector head body

**Result Analysis:**
- Result: Forces user to reinstall end cap before removing injector head body, preventing part loss and maintaining hygiene during disassembly
- Achieves controlled disassembly sequence through passive mechanical means (no user awareness required)

**Risk Assessment:**
The literal infringement risk is medium because a competing product would need to have all elements: (1) an injector head assembly with separable head body and end cap, (2) elastic member on injector body, (3) end cap compressing elastic member in locked position, and (4) elastic member blocking rotation when end cap is removed. A design that uses a different blocking mechanism or disassembly control method could potentially avoid literal infringement.

However, the doctrine of equivalents risk is medium to high because:
- Any alternative elastic blocking mechanism (springs, flexible tabs, compressible rings) that achieves the same function in substantially the same way would likely be considered equivalent
- The functional language in the claims ("configured to," "capable of," "blocks") broadens the scope
- Alternative geometries for the circumferential flange or elastic member placement that achieve the same blocking effect could be captured
- The core inventive concept (using compressed elastic elements to control disassembly sequence) is broadly applicable

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**Strategy 1: Eliminate Elastic Member Blocking Mechanism**
- Implement a positive locking mechanism (detent, snap-fit, or threaded connection) between end cap and injector head body that does not rely on elastic member compression/rebound
- Use a bayonet-style lock or ratchet mechanism that prevents end cap removal when injector head body is in locked position
- Result: Avoids the core claim element of elastic member blocking rotation through rebound

**Strategy 2: Different Disassembly Control Method**
- Design the injector head assembly as a permanently assembled unit (end cap cannot be removed separately)
- Provide multiple end caps for different functions (protection, injection) that are always attached
- Use a sliding cover or rotating shutter instead of removable end cap
- Result: Eliminates the "when end cap is removed" scenario entirely, avoiding the blocking mechanism requirement

**Strategy 3: Alternative Blocking Direction or Method**
- Use a mechanical interlock that blocks axial removal rather than rotational movement
- Implement a sequential unlocking mechanism that requires specific user action (button press, sliding movement) rather than passive elastic blocking
- Position blocking elements on the injector head assembly rather than relying on injector body elastic members
- Result: Achieves disassembly control through different structural arrangement and user interaction

**Strategy 4: Reverse the Compression/Blocking Sequence**
- Design so that elastic members are compressed in the unlocked position and released in the locked position
- Use elastic members that block when compressed rather than when rebounded
- Implement a spring-loaded mechanism on the injector head body that extends (rather than retracts) when end cap is removed
- Result: Inverts the claimed relationship between compression state and blocking function

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe

- **Single-piece injector head assembly:** Designs where the end cap and injector head body are permanently integrated (cannot be separated), eliminating the separable component requirement
- **Non-rotational locking mechanisms:** Attachment methods using pure axial engagement (press-fit, snap-fit) or threaded connections that don't require rotation to a locked position
- **Active locking systems:** Mechanisms requiring deliberate user action (button, lever, slider) to unlock, rather than passive elastic blocking
- **No elastic member on injector body:** Designs that position all retention/blocking features on the injector head assembly itself
- **Magnetic or electronic locks:** Using non-mechanical blocking methods to control disassembly sequence

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area

- **Alternative elastic blocking positions:** Placing compressible elements in different locations (e.g., on injector head body rather than injector body) - May still infringe under doctrine of equivalents if function-way-result is similar
- **Different elastic member geometries:** Using O-rings, wave springs, or foam pads instead of elastic pillars - Likely equivalent if compression/rebound blocking mechanism is the same
- **Multi-stage unlocking:** Requiring multiple rotations or steps to unlock, with elastic elements providing resistance - May be viewed as equivalent depending on specific implementation
- **Circumferential blocking features with gaps:** Using discontinuous blocking surfaces - Claims 12-13 explicitly cover this with alternating flange portions

### ❌ High-Risk / Must Avoid

- **Any design with:**
  - Separable end cap and injector head body
  - Elastic member(s) on injector body distal surface
  - End cap compressing elastic member when in locked position
  - Elastic member rebounding to block rotation when end cap is removed
- **Circumferential flange variations:** Different configurations of the end cap/injector head body interface that form a platform for compressing elastic members - Explicitly covered in dependent claims
- **Alternative elastic materials:** Substituting rubber, silicone, or other compressible materials while maintaining the same compression/rebound blocking function
- **Minor geometric changes:** Adjusting dimensions, shapes, or numbers of elastic members while keeping the core mechanism - Claims already allow flexibility ("at least two")

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity
