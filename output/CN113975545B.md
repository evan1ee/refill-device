# Patent Analysis — CN113975545B

## 1. Patent Identification
- Patent Number: CN113975545B
- Application Date: 2021.11.25
- Grant Date: 2023.10.27
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (北京快舒尔医疗技术有限公司)
- Status: **GRANTED PATENT** (Higher enforceability than CN119607325A)

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem Addressed:**
- Existing injection head assemblies allow the end cap to be removed before the injection head is properly locked onto the injector body
- This creates a severe safety hazard: during high-pressure injection operations, if the injection head is only loosely connected (虚接) to the injector body, the injection head can be ejected along with the high-pressure fluid, causing injury
- Users may inadvertently remove the protective end cap and begin drug aspiration/injection procedures before the injection head is securely locked in place

**Prior Art Deficiencies:**
- Weak or inadequate engagement between drug-containing cavity and end cap
- End cap can be easily removed regardless of injection head installation status
- No safety interlock to prevent premature cap removal
- Risk of injection head detachment during high-pressure injection procedures

**Claimed Advantages:**
- **Safety interlock mechanism**: End cap removal is physically blocked until injection head reaches locked position
- Prevents operation with improperly installed injection head
- Reduces risk of component ejection during injection
- Optional features prevent component loss and improve hygiene

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention provides an injection head assembly with a **position-dependent safety interlock system** that physically prevents end cap removal until the injection head is properly locked onto the injector body. The core innovation is a **constraint-and-release mechanism** where the injector body itself acts as a physical constraint on the first cooperation structure (between end cap and injection head) when the assembly is inserted but not yet rotated to the locked position. Only when the injection head assembly reaches the locked position does the injector body release this constraint, allowing the end cap to be removed.

The system uses a **sequential locking approach** with multiple cooperation structure groups that engage and disengage at different rotational positions during installation, ensuring that the piston rod component locks to the internal push rod while the injection head body locks to the external shell, all while preventing end cap removal until the final locked position is achieved.

**Core Technical Concept:**
State-dependent mechanical constraint where the injector body controls the separability of the end cap based on the injection head assembly's installation position.

**Key Inventive Contribution:**
Using the injector body as an **active constraint element** (not just a passive mounting structure) to prevent deformation of engagement features on the end cap/injection head until the locked position is reached.

**Primary Technical Effect:**
Eliminates the possibility of removing the end cap when the injection head is loosely connected, thereby preventing injection operations with an improperly secured injection head.

## 4. Independent Claims

- **Claim 1**: Injection head assembly for an injector (device) — **Broad**
- **Claim 19**: Injector system including the injection head assembly (system) — **Broad**

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Analysis:**

**Element A** — Injection head main body (210)
- Internal cavity (210c) open at proximal end
- Distal end with micropores connecting cavity to external environment
- Configured to be installed at distal end of injector body

**Element B** — Piston rod component (220)
- Has piston rod (220a) extending distally
- Positioned at proximal side of injection head main body
- Piston rod can extend into the cavity

**Element C** — End cap (230)
- Installed at distal end of injection head main body
- Has opening portion for covering the injection head

**Element D** — Position-dependent constraint mechanism (CORE INNOVATION)
- Injection head assembly is "configured to be capable of being inserted" into distal opening of injector body and "reaching" a locked position
- Injection head assembly is "configured as":
  - **Constraint State**: "When already inserted into the distal opening of the injector body but not yet reached the locked position" → injector body **BLOCKS** axial separation of end cap and injection head main body
  - **Release State**: "When at the locked position" → injector body **BLOCKS** axial relative displacement of injection head main body and injector body **AND ALLOWS** axial separation of end cap and injection head main body

**Functional Language:**
- "configured to be capable of being inserted" (被构造为能够插入)
- "configured as" (被构造为) — defining behavioral states based on position
- "blocks" (阻止) and "allows" (允许) — functional limitation of injector body's role
- "reaching a locked position" — functional positional state
- "axial separation" / "axial relative displacement" — functional movement descriptions

**Structural vs Functional Balance:**
- Structural elements: injection head main body, cavity, micropores, piston rod component, piston rod, end cap
- **Highly functional**: The entire claim scope is defined by HOW the injector body constrains/releases the end cap separation based on position, NOT by specific geometric structures
- NO structural limitations on:
  - How the injector body blocks end cap separation
  - How the injector body releases the constraint at locked position
  - Specific geometry of engagement features
  - Mechanism of detecting "locked position"

**Assessment**: Claim 1 is **very broad** with extremely significant functional language. The core inventive concept (position-dependent constraint) is defined almost entirely functionally.

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
- Injection head assembly with: injection head main body (with cavity and micropores), piston rod component, end cap
- Assembly insertable into injector body's distal opening to reach locked position
- **State 1** (inserted but not locked): Injector body blocks end cap-to-injection head axial separation
- **State 2** (locked position): Injector body blocks injection head-to-injector body axial displacement AND allows end cap-to-injection head axial separation
- Injector system (Claim 19) with: injector body (external shell + internal push rod), injection head assembly, piston inside injection head

### Implicitly Covered

Via functional language "configured to" and "blocks/allows":
- **Any mechanical means** by which the injector body constrains end cap removal before locked position:
  - Radial constraint preventing deformation of snap-fit arms
  - Axial blocking features
  - Interference fits
  - Magnetic or friction-based constraints
- **Any detection mechanism** for determining "locked position":
  - Rotational position sensing
  - Axial position sensing
  - Electronic detection
  - Purely mechanical position-dependent features

Via multiple cooperation structure groups (dependent claims):
- Various fastening mechanisms: snap-fits, threaded connections, bayonet locks
- Various deformation mechanisms: radial deflection of arms, elastic deformation of cap or head body
- Different constraint release mechanisms at locked position

### Disclosed but NOT Claimed

**In Description/Embodiments Only:**
- Specific arm structure (232) extending proximally from end cap main body
- Specific first protrusion (233) on radial inner side of arm
- Specific small step (2111) on first mating feature
- Elastic member (112) protruding slightly from distal face of injector body
- Specific flange (214) arrangement with interruptions defining first mating feature
- Specific radial gap enabling arm deformation only at locked position
- Elastic plug (235) at distal position inside end cap
- Specific rotation-based installation (insert axially, then rotate to lock)
- First transition position and second transition position (intermediate states)
- Specific torque values: first predetermined torque < second predetermined torque
- Third cooperation structure (between piston rod and injection head) with hook and mating groove
- Fourth cooperation structure (between piston rod and internal push rod)
- Sequential disengagement: injection head-piston rod disengages before rotation to locked position
- Safety protrusion features (219, 220c) promoting proper engagement
- Hollow portions (镂空部) in base for weight reduction
- Viewing window (113, 124) for observing medicine bottle
- Anti-rotation key and keyslot (125) between external shell and internal push rod
- Materials, dimensions, specific geometries

**Reuse Opportunity:**
Competitors can study the specific mechanical implementations (arm geometry, step sizes, torque relationships) without infringement as long as they avoid the broad functional claim scope.

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: VERY HIGH**

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: VERY HIGH**

**Justification:**

**Function Analysis:**
- Claimed function: Injector body blocks end cap removal when injection head is inserted but not locked; injector body allows end cap removal when at locked position
- **Extremely broad functional claim** — any needle-free or needle-based injector with a removable cap safety interlock would potentially infringe
- This is a **critical safety function** that many competing injection devices may implement

**Way Analysis:**
- Claimed "way": Injector body acting as constraint element that changes behavior based on position
- Very broad — not limited to:
  - Specific deformable arm structures
  - Radial constraint mechanisms
  - Rotational vs. axial locking
  - Mechanical vs. electronic position detection
- Alternative "ways" that might STILL infringe:
  - Electronic solenoid lock released only at locked position
  - Magnetic constraint system
  - Cam-based lock/unlock mechanism
  - Axial sliding lock instead of rotational

**Result Analysis:**
- Claimed result: Safe injection operation (cannot remove cap until properly locked)
- This is a **highly desirable safety outcome** for all injection devices
- Any competing product achieving this safety result is at risk

**Overall Assessment:**
- **This patent is MORE DANGEROUS than CN119607325A** because:
  - It is a **granted patent** (presumed valid, higher enforceability)
  - Claim scope is **extremely broad and functional**
  - It targets a **critical safety problem** that competitors cannot easily ignore
  - It covers the **entire class** of position-dependent safety interlocks for injection heads

**High Risk Scenarios:**
- Any injection head with removable protective cap that has position-based removal constraints
- Any system where cap removal is prevented until full installation is confirmed
- Any injector with mechanical, magnetic, or electronic interlocks based on installation position
- Needle-free injectors with high-pressure safety requirements

**Lower Risk Scenarios:**
- Injection heads with non-removable caps
- Single-use sealed injection heads (no cap removal needed)
- Systems where cap can be removed at any time (but this eliminates safety benefit)
- Completely different installation verification methods (e.g., visual/electronic indicators only, without mechanical constraint)

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**1. Eliminate Removable Cap Entirely**
- Design injection head with permanently attached protective cover that swings away or slides
- Use iris-style closure that opens/closes without removal
- Single-use design with breakaway seal instead of removable cap
- **Rationale**: Breaks Element C (removable end cap is mandatory claim element)

**2. Allow Cap Removal at Any Position (Accept Safety Trade-off)**
- Design cap with weak magnetic attachment that can always be removed
- Provide only visual/tactile indicators of proper installation
- Rely on user training and visual indicators rather than mechanical constraint
- **Rationale**: Does not meet "blocks axial separation" limitation in constraint state
- **Trade-off**: Loses the safety benefit, may be unacceptable for regulatory approval

**3. Constraint Source is NOT the Injector Body**
- Design a separate locking collar/sleeve that user manually engages after installation
- Use constraint built into the cap-to-head interface that releases based on internal mechanism, not injector body geometry
- Electronic lock on cap itself (battery-powered) that unlocks based on sensor feedback
- **Rationale**: Claim specifies "injector body blocks" — if constraint comes from cap itself or separate component, may avoid literal infringement
- **Risk**: Doctrine of equivalents may still find infringement if function-way-result are substantially similar

**4. Non-Position-Based Release Mechanism**
- Require user to press release button on cap to overcome snap-fit (can be done at any position, but requires deliberate action)
- Time-delay lock: cap can only be removed after 10 seconds from installation (not position-dependent)
- Electronic authentication: cap unlocks only after RFID verification or manual code entry
- **Rationale**: Different from position-based constraint, may be seen as different "way"
- **Trade-off**: May not provide equivalent safety benefit

**5. Reverse the Constraint Logic**
- Cap is always easily removable UNTIL locked position, then becomes secured
- At locked position, cap locks onto the injection head (opposite of claimed behavior)
- Removal requires deliberate unlock action after reaching locked position
- **Rationale**: Opposite functional behavior from claimed system
- **Risk**: May not provide intended safety benefit; may be seen as merely inverting the claim

**6. Multi-Step Installation Without Position-Based Constraint**
- Require user to manually engage secondary locking feature (twist lock on cap itself)
- Visual indicator shows when locked, but cap is mechanically removable at any time
- Audible click or tactile feedback confirms locked position, but no physical blocking
- **Rationale**: Provides installation feedback without mechanical constraint from injector body

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe
- Injection systems with non-removable protective covers (swing-away, sliding shields)
- Single-use sealed injection heads with breakaway seals
- Injection heads with no protective cap (exposed sterile surface with different protection method)
- Systems with purely electronic/visual installation indicators without mechanical constraint
- Injection devices with completely different installation methods (e.g., screw-thread only, no rotation-to-lock)

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch
- Cap removal constraint provided by cap itself (not injector body) — depends on claim interpretation
- Time-based or authentication-based locks (not position-based) — function may be seen as equivalent
- Constraint at different positions in installation sequence (e.g., blocks removal during insertion, allows during rotation)
- Manual unlock button/lever on cap or injection head — if button is only accessible at locked position, may still infringe
- Magnetic or friction-based constraints vs. geometric interference — claim language is broad enough to potentially cover

### ❌ High-Risk / Must Avoid
- Any removable cap system where injector body prevents cap removal before locked position
- Radial constraint preventing deformable features from releasing until rotation to locked position
- Any position-dependent mechanical interlock where injector body geometry controls cap separability
- Systems explicitly designed to prevent cap removal during partial installation
- Bayonet-lock, twist-lock, or rotation-to-lock systems where cap constraint is released at final position
- Any "safety interlock" marketing language combined with position-dependent cap release

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity

### Unclaimed Reusable Features

**From Embodiments:**
- Specific arm length and flexibility characteristics
- Elastic plug (235) inside cap for sealing
- Specific flange interruption patterns for weight reduction
- Viewing window designs (镂空部 + 透明部) for medicine observation
- Specific torque relationships (first predetermined torque < second predetermined torque)
- Sequential engagement sequence with first and second transition positions
- Safety protrusion features (219, 220c) for promoting engagement
- Anti-rotation key/keyslot (125) between shell and push rod
- Specific step heights and radial dimensions
- Elastic member (112) design for compression at locked position

**Usage Guidance:**
These specific implementations can be studied for inspiration in non-infringing designs, but the core functional concept (position-based constraint from injector body) must be avoided.

### Improvement Opportunities

**Unclaimed Technical Needs:**
1. **Electronic position verification** — Add sensors to electronically confirm locked position and provide feedback
2. **Haptic feedback optimization** — Improve tactile feel of rotation-to-lock mechanism
3. **One-handed installation** — Current design may require two hands; single-hand operation would improve usability
4. **Color-coded position indicators** — Visual aids showing installation progress
5. **Audible confirmation** — Distinct sounds at transition positions and locked position
6. **Force-feedback limits** — Prevent over-rotation or over-insertion damage
7. **Misalignment prevention** — Features that guide correct angular alignment before insertion

5. **Manufacturing/Cost Optimization**
   - Simplified constraint mechanisms with fewer parts
   - Injection-moldable single-piece designs
   - Materials selection for optimal deformation characteristics

**Strategic Note:**
Since CN113975545B and CN119607325A are both from Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd., the company appears to be building a **comprehensive patent portfolio** around needle-free injection head assemblies. Competitors should:
- Monitor for additional patent applications from this entity
- Consider freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis before entering this market space
- Investigate licensing opportunities if design-arounds are not commercially viable
- Focus innovation on areas not covered by Kuaishuer's patent family

**Relationship Between Patents:**
- CN119607325A: Focuses on **orientation guidance** during cap installation (guiding ribs)
- CN113975545B: Focuses on **safety interlock** preventing cap removal before locking
- These patents may be **complementary** — a product could potentially infringe BOTH if it has guided installation AND position-dependent safety interlock

**Critical Business Consideration:**
CN113975545B is a **granted patent** with presumption of validity. Any commercial needle-free injector development should include:
- Formal freedom-to-operate (FTO) opinion from patent counsel
- Design review against this patent's claim scope
- Consideration of licensing from Kuaishuer if design-around is not feasible
