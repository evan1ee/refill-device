# Patent Analysis — CN111558113A

## 1. Patent Identification
- Patent Number: CN111558113A
- Title: Needleless Injector Body and Needleless Injector (无针注射器主体和无针注射器)
- Publication Date: 2020.08.21
- Application Date: 2020.04.30
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishu'er Medical Technology Co., Ltd.

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem:**
Previous needleless injectors require cumbersome operations where the drug vial must be removed and the drug tube separated from the vial during drug extraction and injection procedures. This process is inefficient and labor-intensive.

**Deficiencies of Prior Art:**
- Complex drug extraction operations requiring vial removal
- Existing solutions either use one-time disposable cartridges (high cost, material safety concerns for long-term drug contact) or require separating the vial each time
- Slow drug extraction due to lack of assisted pressure mechanisms

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Can accommodate refillable drug vials (e.g., cartridge bottles) permanently inside the injector
- Completes both drug extraction and injection in each use without vial removal
- Accelerates drug extraction through a supplementary drug pusher that actively compresses the vial stopper
- Efficient, labor-saving operation
- Eliminates need to remove vial or separate drug tube from vial
- Prevents vial loss and contamination

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The core invention is a refillable needleless injector system that integrates a supplementary drug pusher mechanism. The key innovation is the ability to house a standard drug vial (like a cartridge bottle) permanently within the injector body while actively facilitating drug extraction through automated stopper compression.

**Key Technical Concept:**
A transmission device converts the relative rotational/linear motion between the base and outer shell (used for normal operation) into forward motion of a supplementary drug pusher. This pusher compresses the vial's stopper during drug extraction, increasing internal vial pressure and accelerating drug flow into the injection chamber.

**Primary Technical Effect:**
- Enables multi-use operation with a housed refillable vial without removal
- Accelerates drug extraction through active vial compression
- Simplifies user operation to simple twisting/rotating motions
- Maintains sterility by keeping vial enclosed

## 4. Independent Claims

- **Claim 1:** Needleless injector body (device) - **Broad**
  - Covers the main structural components and functional relationships

- **Claim 32:** Complete needleless injector (system) - **Broad**
  - Includes injector body plus injection head assembly

- **Claim 33:** Needleless injector with specific injection head configuration (system) - **Medium**
  - Adds details about injection head structure with drug tube, piston rod, and one-way valve

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Elements:**

- **Element A - Base (31):** Forward-facing opening structure that provides rear housing support

- **Element B - Outer Shell (32):** Rearward-facing opening, mounts on base front end creating accommodation space, has front opening for fixedly mounting drug tube

- **Element C - Internal Pusher System (334):** Located in accommodation space with forward-facing opening, fixedly accommodates drug vial inside, piston rod fixed at forward opening

- **Element D - Supplementary Drug Pusher (8):** Mounted at rear end of internal pusher, front end contacts vial stopper

- **Element E - Transmission Device:** One part connects to supplementary drug pusher, another part directly/indirectly connects to base or outer shell

**Functional Relationships:**
- Outer shell moves forward/backward relative to internal pusher, driving drug tube relative to vial and piston rod for extraction and injection
- During extraction: base or outer shell drives supplementary pusher through transmission device to push vial stopper forward, compressing vial internal space

**Functional Language:**
- "configured to" (构造为)
- "capable of" (能够)
- "can move" (能够移动)
- "can contact" (能够接触)
- Extensive use of functional limitations defining component interactions

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
Mixed approach - Components are structurally defined (base, shell, pushers as distinct physical elements) but their operational relationships are functionally defined through relative movements and force transmission. The transmission device is particularly functional, claiming any mechanism that achieves the described motion transfer.

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
- Needleless injector body with multi-part housing (base + outer shell)
- Internal pusher system for holding vial and piston rod
- Supplementary drug pusher mechanism
- Transmission device connecting pusher to base/outer shell
- Relative movement between outer shell and internal pusher for drug operations
- Active vial compression during drug extraction via supplementary pusher
- Locking mechanism for maintaining position during extraction
- Elastic actuation mechanism for injection force

### Implicitly Covered
- Any transmission mechanism type (mechanical, linkage-based, gear-driven) that transfers motion to supplementary pusher
- Various locking mechanism implementations (mechanical, electromagnetic as mentioned in claim 21)
- Different motion conversion mechanisms (rotational to linear via threads, rack and pinion, cam systems)
- Multiple configurations of nut members for engaging/disengaging with supplementary pusher
- One-way rotational transmission mechanisms (one-way bearings, ratchets, clutches)

### Disclosed but Not Claimed
- Specific materials (transparent or hollow sections for viewing vial contents)
- Precise screw thread configurations and pitches
- Exact dimensional ratios and proportions
- Specific spring arrangement patterns (coaxial vs. parallel spring shafts)
- Detailed valve core geometries (spherical, conical-cylindrical hybrid)
- Aesthetic design features
- Specific manufacturing methods
- Injection head cap/cover designs

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: HIGH**

A competing refillable needleless injector product would highly likely require:
- ✓ Housing structure (base + outer shell configuration)
- ✓ Mechanism to retain vial and piston assembly
- ✓ Relative movement between components for drug extraction/injection
- ✓ Some form of assisted drug extraction mechanism

The claims are broadly drafted to cover most practical implementations of refillable needleless injectors with assisted extraction.

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: HIGH**

**Justification:**

- **Function:** Accelerate drug extraction from a permanently housed vial by actively compressing the vial's internal space

- **Way:** Using a supplementary pusher mechanism driven by a transmission device that converts user operation motions (rotation/linear movement of outer shell) into pusher advancement during extraction phase

- **Result:** Efficient, rapid drug extraction into injection chamber without requiring vial removal, separation of components, or manual vial compression

**Equivalents Analysis:**
Alternative mechanisms achieving substantially the same function through similar means would likely be captured:
- Pneumatic/hydraulic compression of vial space
- Magnetic or electromagnetic actuation of pusher
- Cable or belt-driven pusher systems
- Cam-activated compression mechanisms
- Spring-loaded automatic compression systems

All these alternatives perform the same function (vial compression during extraction), operate in substantially the same way (automated actuation linked to extraction operation), and achieve the same result (accelerated drug extraction without vial removal).

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**Strategy 1: Removable Vial Architecture**
- Design injector requiring vial removal for refilling/drug extraction
- Use quick-release vial mounting that explicitly is NOT "fixedly accommodated"
- Vial snaps in/out for each use cycle
- *Trade-off:* Less convenient, but avoids "fixedly accommodated" limitation

**Strategy 2: Passive Pressure Equalization System**
- Eliminate active supplementary pusher mechanism entirely
- Use passive vent valves or air channels to equalize pressure during extraction
- Rely on piston movement alone to create extraction vacuum
- *Trade-off:* Slower drug extraction, but avoids key claim element

**Strategy 3: Pre-Pressurized Vial Design**
- Use specially designed vials with internal spring-loaded stopper or gas pressure
- Vial itself provides compression force, not the injector
- No separate "supplementary drug pusher" in injector body needed
- *Trade-off:* Requires proprietary consumable vials, increases vial cost

**Strategy 4: User-Activated Direct Compression**
- Include manual button/lever allowing user to directly compress vial when desired
- Compression is separate action from extraction motion, not automated via transmission device
- *Trade-off:* Requires additional user action, less elegant operation

**Strategy 5: Alternative Motion Architecture**
- Use pure linear sliding motion for all operations (no rotational components)
- Use button/trigger/lever activation instead of twisting motions
- Direct mechanical advantage systems instead of screw-based motion conversion
- *Trade-off:* Different user experience, may require more force

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe

- **Traditional needleless injectors** requiring vial removal and reattachment for each use cycle
- **Single-dose disposable systems** with pre-filled non-refillable cartridges
- **Jet injectors** without housed vial mechanisms (external vial attachment)
- **Manual compression systems** where user physically squeezes vial separate from extraction motion
- **Passive extraction systems** without active stopper compression assistance
- **Different application area devices** (e.g., industrial/veterinary injectors with fundamentally different structures)

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch Area

- **Refillable systems with removable vials** - safe if vial is genuinely removable/replaceable, risky if removal is merely theoretically possible but impractical
- **Vial compression via alternative methods** - depends on how different the mechanism truly is from claimed transmission device approach
- **Partial feature adoption** - using housed vial OR assisted compression alone (not both) reduces risk but requires careful claim analysis
- **Non-twisting operation mechanisms** - may avoid some dependent claims but still risk independent claim coverage

### ❌ Must Avoid (High-Risk)

- **Refillable needleless injector with permanently/fixedly housed vial**
- **Active stopper compression during drug extraction phase**
- **Automated compression linked to extraction operation** (transmission device connecting user operation to pusher)
- **Rotational-to-linear motion conversion** for simultaneous extraction and compression
- **Any system combining:** fixed vial accommodation + supplementary pusher + transmission device
- **Obvious modifications** of disclosed embodiments (different screw pitches, spring arrangements, bearing types)

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity
