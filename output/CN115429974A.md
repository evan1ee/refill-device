# Patent Analysis — CN115429974A

## 1. Patent Identification
- Patent Number: CN115429974A
- Title: Needleless Injector (无针注射器)
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd.
- Application Date: 2022.09.07
- Publication Date: 2022.12.06
- Status: Application (not granted)

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem Addressed:**
- Existing needleless injectors have complex structures
- During pre-injection pressurization, the piston pushrod inside the injector tends to shift or displace
- This premature displacement prevents proper pressurization, making injection impossible
- Need for simplified structure with reliable pressure accumulation mechanism

**Claimed Advantages:**
- Enables convenient locking of piston assembly during movement from first to second position
- Facilitates injection of medication into injection chamber
- Allows pressurization and energy storage for subsequent injection
- Automatic unlocking mechanism when piston reaches second position
- Simplified operation and improved reliability

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The core innovation is a **needleless injector with automatic locking/unlocking mechanism** featuring:

1. A **piston assembly** movable between:
   - First position (near injection micropore)
   - Second position (away from injection micropore)

2. A **locking device** that:
   - Maintains piston assembly in locked state during movement from first to second position
   - Prevents premature return to first position during pressurization
   - Automatically unlocks when piston assembly reaches second position
   - Allows driven return to first position after unlocking to perform high-pressure injection

The key inventive contribution is the **automatic position-dependent locking mechanism** that enables safe energy accumulation during the charging stroke, then releases precisely when maximum displacement is reached, allowing rapid injection delivery. This solves the problem of premature piston movement during pressurization.

## 4. Independent Claims

**Claim 1:** Device claim - Needleless injector with injection component, piston assembly, and locking device (Broad)

The patent contains 34 dependent claims with only 1 independent claim, indicating a broad pioneering claim with extensive variation coverage through dependent claims.

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Elements:**

- **Element A:** Injection component (101) comprising:
  - Injection chamber shell (104) forming injection chamber
  - Injection micropore (106) at front end communicating with exterior and injection chamber

- **Element B:** Piston assembly (105) disposed in injection chamber, configured to move between:
  - First position near injection micropore (106)
  - Second position away from injection micropore (106)

- **Element C:** Locking device configured to:
  - Maintain piston assembly (105) in locked state during movement from first position to second position
  - Automatically unlock piston assembly (105) when reaching second position
  - When locked: restrict return to first position
  - When unlocked: allow driven return to first position

**Functional Language:**
- "configured to" - functional capability
- "able to move" - functional motion
- "being restricted" - functional limitation
- "can be driven" - functional actuation

**Structural vs Functional Assessment:**
The claim is heavily functional, defining the locking device primarily by what it does (locks during movement, unlocks at position, restricts/allows return) rather than specific structural features. The positional elements (first/second position) and basic structural components (shell, micropore, piston) provide minimal structural limitation. This broad functional claiming provides wide coverage but may face enablement challenges.

## 6. Protection Scope Analysis

### Explicitly Claimed
- Injection chamber with injection micropore for drug delivery
- Piston assembly movable between two defined positions
- Locking device with position-dependent locking/unlocking behavior
- Locked state prevents return to first position
- Unlocked state allows driven return to first position
- Automatic unlocking triggered by reaching second position

### Implicitly Covered
- Various locking mechanisms (mechanical stops, detents, catches, latches)
- Different unlocking triggers (position sensors, mechanical displacement, cam profiles)
- Multiple driving systems for return motion (springs, compressed gas, motors)
- Alternative piston assembly configurations
- Various injection micropore geometries and sizes
- Different structural implementations of stop/catch engagement

### Disclosed but Not Claimed
- Specific stop flange (135) and stop portion (134) engagement mechanism
- Locking sleeve (133) as specific locking device implementation
- Radial displacement of stop portion into recessed portion (137)
- Injection pushrod (118) connecting to piston assembly

- Specific dimensional relationships and materials

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: Medium-High**

A competing needleless injector with energy storage/pressurization mechanism would likely contain:
- Injection chamber with micropore (Element A) - standard in all needleless injectors
- Movable piston assembly (Element B) - required for pressure generation
- Some form of locking during pressurization (Element C) - common practice to prevent premature release

The broad functional language of Claim 1 captures many implementations, but:
- Devices with manual locks (not automatic) may avoid Element C
- Simultaneous pressurization/injection without distinct positions may avoid
- Alternative energy storage methods (pre-compressed spring always engaged) may differ

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: Medium**

**Function-Way-Result Analysis:**
- **Function:** Enable energy accumulation during piston retraction while preventing premature release, then trigger injection at predetermined position
- **Way:** Position-dependent automatic locking during movement, automatic unlocking at second position, driven return for injection
- **Result:** Reliable pressurization without displacement, precise injection timing, simplified operation

**Equivalents that pose risk:**
- Time-based locking (lock for duration rather than position) - same function, different way
- Force-threshold unlocking (unlock when sufficient force applied) - same result, different trigger
- Continuous ratchet mechanism allowing incremental advancement - similar way
- Electronic position sensors with solenoid locks - same function, electronic implementation

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**Strategy 1: Eliminate Automatic Unlocking**
- Use manual unlock mechanism requiring user action to release piston
- Breaks Element C requirement for "automatically unlock"
- Adds safety step requiring deliberate user activation
- **Trade-off:** Less convenient operation, requires two-handed use or additional step

**Strategy 2: Eliminate Distinct Position-Based Locking**
- Design with continuously variable resistance (friction-based or magnetic damping) rather than locked/unlocked states
- User manually controls position throughout stroke
- Breaks Element C's position-dependent lock/unlock behavior
- **Trade-off:** Requires user to maintain force during pressurization; less foolproof

**Strategy 3: Reverse Direction of Energy Storage**
- Piston moves toward (not away from) injection micropore during pressurization
- Energy stored in forward position, released by retracting
- Breaks Element B's specific directional movement (first position near, second position away)
- **Trade-off:** Counterintuitive operation; may complicate drug loading

**Strategy 4: Eliminate Driven Return Mechanism**
- User manually pushes piston from second to first position for injection
- No automatic driving device
- Breaks Element C's "can be driven to return" functional requirement
- **Trade-off:** Requires user force application; injection pressure may vary with user strength

**Strategy 5: Use Pre-Compressed Constant Force Spring**
- Spring always applies force; no locking/unlocking cycle
- Single continuous motion from loaded to injected state
- No distinct first/second positions with locked state between them
- Breaks Element C entirely (no locking device)
- **Trade-off:** Cannot hold at pressurized state; immediate injection upon activation

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe
- **Traditional fillable injectors** without pre-pressurization energy storage
- **Manual push injectors** where user provides all force during injection (no energy accumulation phase)
- **Spring-only designs** with pre-compressed spring that does not require retraction/locking
- **Rotary actuation** where turning motion (not linear position) controls injection
- **Manually locked devices** with user-operated lock/unlock lever (not automatic)
- **Single-action injectors** without separate pressurization and injection phases

### ⚠ Conditional/Watch Area
- **Electronic locking systems** with position sensors - may be equivalent
- **Time-delayed unlocking** rather than position-based - similar function
- **Force-threshold release mechanisms** - may fall under DoE
- **Ratchet mechanisms** allowing incremental advancement - structural difference but functional similarity
- **Mechanical timers** that unlock after set duration - different trigger mechanism
- **User-controlled variable resistance** without true locked state - gray area on "locking device"

### ❌ High-Risk/Must Avoid
- **Automatic position-dependent locking** during piston retraction from first to second position
- **Automatic unlocking at second position** triggering injection capability
- **Any locked state preventing return** from second to first position before unlocking
- **Driven return mechanism** activated after automatic unlock
- **Two-phase operation:** pressurization (locked) then injection (unlocked after reaching position)
- **Mechanical stop engagement** that releases upon reaching predetermined displacement

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity

### Unclaimed Reusable Features
- **Specific locking sleeve design** (133) with internal stop flange - specific structure
- **Radial displacement mechanism** with recessed portion (137) - implementation detail
- **Transmission devices:** Gear/rack (139/140/141), pulley/belt (371/372), chain/sprocket - generic mechanisms
- **Compressed gas drive** with dual sealing rings (481/482) creating sealed compression chamber - novel implementation
- **Threaded actuation** with rotating part (142) and nut (146) for medication delivery - unclaimed
- **Pre-filled storage component** (102) with movable drug pusher - similar to CN115337503B but not claimed here
- **Safety device** (120) between chambers - mentioned but not claimed in independent claim

### Improvement Opportunities
- **Adjustable unlock position:** Mechanism to vary the second position, enabling dose control
- **Graduated locking:** Multiple locking positions for multi-dose delivery from single cartridge
- **Feedback mechanisms:** Audible/tactile clicks confirming lock engagement and unlock
- **Visual indicators:** Windows showing lock state and piston position
- **Force limiting:** Maximum force cutoffs preventing over-pressurization
- **Unlock confirmation:** Positive indication that unlocking occurred before injection can proceed
- **Fail-safe mechanisms:** Automatic safety engagement if device is dropped during pressurization

### Follow-up Patent Potential
**Yes - Moderate potential for improvement patents:**

1. **Dose metering via unlock position:** Adjustable second-position stop determining injection volume
2. **Multi-stage locking:** Graduated locks for fractional dose delivery
3. **Smart unlocking systems:** Electronic position sensing with controlled solenoid release
4. **Pressure monitoring:** Sensors measuring accumulated pressure before unlock
5. **Unlock safety interlocks:** Secondary confirmation required before unlock (e.g., must be pressed against skin)
6. **Manufacturing methods:** Automated assembly of locking mechanism components
7. **Alternative unlock triggers:** Temperature-based, time-based, or force-based unlocking

The base patent broadly claims the locking/unlocking concept but leaves room for specific implementations, control mechanisms, and enhanced safety/usability features.

**Relationship to CN115337503B:**
Both patents from same applicant filed same day (2022.09.07). CN115337503B focuses on pre-filled storage with safety device and sequential actuation. CN115429974A focuses specifically on the locking mechanism during pressurization. These appear to be divisional or related applications covering different aspects of the same overall device design.

**Conclusion:** This patent addresses a specific operational problem (premature piston movement during pressurization) with a broad functional solution. It poses moderate infringement risk to needleless injectors with automated energy storage mechanisms, but multiple design-around strategies exist by changing the locking method, timing, or elimination of distinct phases.
