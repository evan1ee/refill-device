- Application Date: 2025.01.07
- Publication Date: 2025.03.14
- Applicant: Beijing Kuaishuer Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (北京快舒尔医疗技术有限公司)
- Status: **PUBLISHED APPLICATION** (Not yet granted, lower enforceability than CN113975545B)

## 2. Patent Purpose & Technical Problem

**Technical Problem Addressed:**
- Existing piston rods in needle-free injectors have multiple deficiencies:
  - **Aspiration problem**: Medicine is difficult to draw into the drug tube's containment cavity from storage container
  - **Backflow problem**: During injection, medicine easily backflows from drug tube back to internal storage container
  - **Control problem**: No existing design provides precise control over medicine flow direction and pathways during both aspiration and injection processes
- Current technology lacks a piston rod design that can reliably ensure proper flow in aspiration and prevent backflow during injection

**Prior Art Deficiencies:**
- Inadequate sealing between piston portion and rod portion
- No directional flow control mechanism
- Cannot guarantee medicine enters drug tube during aspiration
- Cannot prevent backflow during high-pressure injection
- Complex operation requiring professional medical personnel

**Claimed Advantages:**
- **Uni-directional seal structure**: Automatically opens during aspiration, seals during injection
- Precise control of medicine flow direction in both operational phases
- Ensures medicine easily enters drug tube during aspiration
- Prevents backflow to storage container during injection
- Simplified operation suitable for home use by non-professionals

## 3. Core Invention Summary

The invention provides a piston rod for needle-free injectors with a **state-dependent uni-directional seal structure** formed at the interface between the piston portion and rod portion. The core innovation is a **pressure-responsive sealing mechanism** that automatically changes between "open" and "sealed" states based on the operational phase (aspiration vs. injection).

During aspiration, the piston portion moves to a distal "open position" relative to the rod portion, creating a gap between matching conical surfaces. This gap allows medicine to flow from the storage container through the seal structure into the drug tube's containment cavity. The negative pressure created by rearward piston movement and/or impact pressure from incoming medicine keeps the seal open.

During injection, forward injection pressure pushes the piston portion to a proximal "sealed position," where the outer conical surface of the piston portion's boss tightly contacts the inner conical surface of the rod portion's recess, forming a complete axial seal that prevents any backflow from the drug tube to the storage container.

**Core Technical Concept:**
Pressure-differential-actuated uni-directional seal that passively adapts to operational phase without active control mechanisms.

**Key Inventive Contribution:**
The complementary conical surface design (outer conical boss on piston + inner conical recess on rod) that creates gap-based flow paths during aspiration and tight contact seal during injection, controlled solely by pressure differentials inherent to the operational phases.

**Primary Technical Effect:**
Automatic, passive control of medicine flow direction ensuring aspiration efficiency and injection reliability without manual seal activation or complex valving mechanisms.

## 4. Independent Claims

- **Claim 1**: Piston rod for needle-free injector (device) — **Broad**
- **Claim 19**: Injection head including piston rod (assembly) — **Broad**
- **Claim 20**: Needle-free injector system (system) — **Broad**

## 5. Broadest Independent Claim Decomposition

**Claim 1 Analysis:**

**Element A** — Rod portion (221)
- Extends along axial direction
- Has distal portion with specific features (detailed in dependent claims)

**Element B** — Piston portion (222)
- Located distally to rod portion in axial direction
- Connected to rod portion
- Can move axially relative to drug tube

**Element C** — Uni-directional seal structure (CORE INNOVATION)
- Formed by cooperation of piston portion's (222) proximal end and rod portion's (221) distal portion
- **Configured as uni-directional seal structure** capable of:
  - **Open State**: During aspiration process, maintains open state to allow medicine from storage container (4) to be drawn into drug tube (21)
  - **Sealed State**: During injection process, maintains sealed state to prevent medicine from backflowing from drug tube (21) to storage container (4)

**Functional Language:**
- "configured as" (被构造为) — defining structural configuration by functional behavior
- "capable of...maintaining open state" (能够在...保持打开状态) — functional capability limitation
- "capable of...maintaining sealed state" (能够在...保持密封状态) — functional capability limitation
- "during aspiration process" / "during injection process" — state-dependent functional behavior
- "to allow" (以允许) — functional purpose language
- "to prevent" (以阻止) — functional blocking limitation

**Structural vs Functional Balance:**
- Minimal structural elements: rod portion, piston portion, connection between them
- **Highly functional core limitation**: The entire inventive concept is defined by HOW the seal structure behaves in different operational states, NOT by specific geometric structures
- NO structural limitations on:
  - Specific geometry of sealing surfaces (conical, cylindrical, spherical, etc.)
  - Mechanism of achieving "open state" (gap, channel, valve, etc.)
  - Mechanism of achieving "sealed state" (interference fit, contact pressure, material deformation, etc.)
  - How the seal structure "knows" which operational phase is occurring
  - Specific pressure values or force thresholds triggering state changes

**Assessment**: Claim 1 is **very broad** with extremely significant functional language. The core inventive concept (uni-directional seal responsive to operational phase) is defined almost entirely functionally with minimal structural limitations.

## 7. Infringement Risk Evaluation

**Literal Infringement Risk: VERY HIGH**

**Doctrine of Equivalents Risk: VERY HIGH**

**Justification:**

**Function Analysis:**
- Claimed function: Seal structure maintains open state during aspiration (allowing medicine entry) and maintains sealed state during injection (preventing backflow)
- **Extremely broad functional claim** — covers ANY seal design in a piston rod that:
  - Permits flow during aspiration phase
  - Blocks flow during injection phase
- This is a **fundamental operational requirement** for needle-free injectors with internal storage containers
- Any competing product solving the backflow problem will likely implement this function

**Way Analysis:**
- Claimed "way": Cooperation between piston portion's proximal end and rod portion's distal portion forming uni-directional seal structure
- Very broad — not limited to:
  - Specific surface geometries (conical vs. cylindrical vs. spherical)
  - Specific sealing mechanism (interference fit, material compression, magnetic attraction)
  - Specific actuation method (pressure differential, mechanical linkage, spring force)
  - Specific flow path configuration when open (gap, holes, channels)
  - Number of sealing surfaces or contact areas

- Alternative "ways" that might STILL infringe:
  - Ball check valve between piston and rod
  - Lip seal that deforms under pressure differential
  - Magnetic seal that releases under aspiration negative pressure
  - Spring-loaded valve that opens during aspiration
  - Duckbill valve or other elastomeric one-way valve
  - Flapper valve design
  - Reed valve between piston and rod portions

**Result Analysis:**
- Claimed result: Precise control of medicine flow direction (inward during aspiration, no backflow during injection)
- This is a **highly desirable operational outcome** essential for proper injector function
- Any competing product achieving reliable aspiration and injection will achieve this result
- Regulatory approval for needle-free injectors may REQUIRE this level of flow control

**Overall Assessment:**
- **This patent is DANGEROUS** because:
  - Very broad functional claiming with minimal structural limitations
  - Covers a **fundamental flow control problem** in needle-free injectors
  - Targets operational behavior (aspiration + injection) rather than specific mechanism
  - Any solution preventing backflow during injection is at risk
  - Function-way-result test will capture many alternative designs

- **Comparison to other patents**:
  - CN119607325A: Orientation guidance (medium-high risk)
  - CN113975545B: Safety interlock (very high risk, granted)
  - **CN119633206A: Uni-directional seal (very high risk, but not yet granted)**

**High Risk Scenarios:**
- Any piston rod with differential sealing behavior between aspiration and injection
- Any design where seal opens/releases during aspiration phase
- Any design where seal closes/tightens during injection phase
- Valve-based designs between piston and rod portions
- Pressure-responsive sealing mechanisms
- Any product marketed as "preventing backflow during injection"

**Lower Risk Scenarios:**
- Designs with no internal storage container (external vial only) — but this eliminates convenience advantage
- Designs where medicine pathway completely bypasses piston-rod interface
- Constant seal (always sealed or always open) designs — but these don't solve backflow problem
- Completely different operational principles (e.g., peristaltic pump, screw-driven displacement)

## 8. Design-Around Strategies

**1. Eliminate Internal Storage Container**
- Use only external vial attached to injector during use
- Medicine flows directly from external vial to injection head without passing through piston-rod seal
- **Rationale**: Breaks functional requirement — no internal storage means no backflow problem to solve
- **Trade-off**: Loses convenience of self-contained system; requires external vial handling

**2. Constant Full-Flow Pathway (No Seal)**
- Design piston-rod interface with permanent, non-closing flow channels
- Prevent backflow using alternative method (e.g., external valve, separate check valve upstream)
- **Rationale**: No "uni-directional seal structure" between piston and rod if pathway never seals
- **Trade-off**: Requires additional components; may be less elegant solution

**3. Seal Location Different from Piston-Rod Interface**
- Place uni-directional seal elsewhere in flow path (e.g., at storage container outlet, in drug tube inlet)
- Piston-rod interface remains simple mechanical connection without sealing function
- **Rationale**: Claim specifies seal "formed by cooperation of piston portion's proximal end and rod portion's distal portion"
- **Risk**: May still infringe if seal is functionally equivalent to claimed location

**4. Active Valving with User Control**
- Require user to manually open/close valve between storage and drug tube
- Not an automatic "uni-directional seal structure" responding passively to pressure
- **Rationale**: Different "way" — requires active user intervention, not passive pressure response
- **Trade-off**: More complex operation; defeats simplicity advantage

**5. Reverse Pressure Logic**
- Seal closes during aspiration (vacuum holds seal shut), opens during injection (pressure opens seal)
- Medicine flows through alternative pathway during aspiration (e.g., bypass channel)
- **Rationale**: Opposite functional behavior from claimed invention
- **Risk**: May be seen as merely inverting the claim; unclear if patentably distinct

**6. Separate Piston and Rod Without Cooperation**
- Piston floats independently without forming cooperative seal structure with rod
- Rod pushes piston from behind without engagement at sealing surfaces
- Seal formed within piston itself or within drug tube, not between piston and rod
- **Rationale**: No "cooperation" between piston and rod forming seal
- **Feasibility**: Engineering challenge to maintain piston alignment and control

**7. Dual-Chamber Design**
- Aspiration chamber separate from injection chamber
- Transfer medicine from aspiration to injection chamber in intermediate step
- No backflow risk because chambers are isolated
- **Rationale**: Different system architecture; no single seal controlling both phases
- **Trade-off**: More complex; larger size; additional operational step

## 9. Safe Design Space

### ✅ Clearly Safe
- Injectors with external storage only (no internal container)
- Systems with constant open pathway between piston and rod + backflow prevention elsewhere
- Designs where medicine never flows through piston-rod interface
- Completely different injection mechanisms (peristaltic pumps, screw drives)
- Pre-filled single-use injection heads with no aspiration function
- Systems using separate components for aspiration vs. injection (no dual-function piston rod)

### ⚠ Conditional / Watch
- Uni-directional seals located elsewhere in flow path (not at piston-rod interface) — depends on claim interpretation of "cooperation" location
- Active user-controlled valves (not passive pressure-responsive) — function may still be equivalent
- Reverse pressure logic (closes during aspiration, opens during injection) — may be seen as obvious inversion
- Constant partial seal with pressure-relief feature — might avoid "maintains sealed state" limitation
- Mechanical one-way valves (ball check, flapper) not formed by piston-rod cooperation — depends on scope of "cooperation"

### ❌ High-Risk / Must Avoid
- Any seal between piston portion and rod portion that opens during aspiration and closes during injection
- Pressure-differential-actuated seals at piston-rod interface
- Conical, cylindrical, or spherical surface contact seals with gap/contact state changes
- Deformable seals (O-rings, lip seals) that compress during injection, relax during aspiration
- Any design explicitly marketed as "preventing backflow during injection through piston-rod seal"
- Automatic (passive) seal state changes based on operational phase
- Gap-based flow paths during aspiration + tight contact during injection at piston-rod interface

## 10. Reuse & Patent Opportunity

### Unclaimed Reusable Features

**From Embodiments:**
- Specific conical angle relationships between inner and outer surfaces
- Multiple engagement structures (circumferential claws 2214 vs. continuous flange 2214')
- Convex ring (22213) design on piston head cylindrical portion with notches (22214)
- Multiple parallel convex rings with overlapping notch positions
- Specific dimensional relationships (outer diameter of second annular portion < first annular/main body)
- Annular groove design for O-ring secondary seal (2218)
- Aperture (2217) configurations in first annular portion
- Elongated channel in rod main body for aspiration needle
- Conical piston head portion (22211) for medicine compression
- Cylindrical piston head portion (22212) for guidance
- Two convex ring arrangement per embodiment
- Specific materials and manufacturing methods

**Usage Guidance:**
These specific implementations can be studied for inspiration in non-infringing designs, but the core functional concept (pressure-responsive uni-directional seal between piston and rod) must be avoided or implemented outside the claimed scope.

**Combined Infringement Risk:**
A single competing product could potentially infringe ALL THREE patents if it includes:
1. Guided cap installation (CN119607325A)
2. Position-dependent safety interlock (CN113975545B)
3. Uni-directional piston-rod seal (CN119633206A)

**Critical Business Considerations:**
- Beijing Kuaishuer is building a **patent wall** around needle-free injector technology
- Freedom-to-operate (FTO) analysis is **ESSENTIAL** before entering this market
- **CN113975545B** (granted) poses immediate threat
- **CN119633206A** and **CN119607325A** (pending) may become equally dangerous if granted
- Consider licensing negotiations with Kuaishuer if design-arounds are not commercially viable
- Monitor for additional patent applications from this entity
- Focus innovation on unclaimed design spaces identified in this analysis

**Patent Family Relationship:**
These three patents appear to be **co-pending applications** forming a comprehensive portfolio. Product design should account for the cumulative scope of all three to ensure freedom to operate.
