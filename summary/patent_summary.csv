"CN111558112B","Injection Head","2021-09-24","Traditional needleless injectors require complex drug loading: install drug tube, draw medicine from vial using needle, separate tube from vial. Process is cumbersome and time-consuming.","Device","A: Drug tube with chamber and micro-hole; B: Piston rod with piston; C: Rear end insertion into vial; D: Internal drug channel; E: Joint installation relationship","Internal drug channel in piston rod enables in-situ aspiration from stored vial; one-way valve prevents backflow contamination","High","1) External vial connection; 2) Pre-filled cartridge without on-device aspiration"
"CN111558113A","Needleless Injector Body and Needleless Injector","2020-08-21 (Pub)","Previous needleless injectors require cumbersome operations where drug vial must be removed and drug tube separated from vial during extraction and injection. Process is inefficient.","Device","A: Base with forward opening; B: Outer shell mounting on base; C: Internal pusher system; D: Supplementary drug pusher; E: Transmission device","Transmission device converts rotational/linear motion to forward motion of supplementary drug pusher, compressing vial stopper during extraction","High","1) Removable vial architecture; 2) Passive pressure equalization system"
"CN113975539B","Injection Head Assembly","2023-10-20","Injection head components must be individually engaged with injector body; engagement process is complex requiring manual user operation and risk of incomplete assembly.","Device","A: Injection head assembly for injector body; B: Injection head body with cavity and piston rod; C: Sequential insertion/rotation positions; D: Automatic locking/disengaging mechanism","Sequential rotational engagement with automated unlocking triggered by continued rotation; eliminates manual component manipulation","High","1) Manual component engagement; 2) Linear axial installation without rotation"
"CN113975540B","Injector Head Assembly, Injector Body and Injector","2023-12-26","After injector head assembly installed and end cap removed, injector head body can rotate and be removed independently, leading to part loss and hygiene issues.","Device","A: Injector head body with proximal cavity; B: End cap at distal end; C: Insertion and rotation capability; D: Elastic member compression; E: Blocking mechanism on rebound","Elastic member rebounds when end cap removed to block rotation; forces end cap reinstallation before removal enabling unit removal","Medium","1) Eliminate elastic member blocking; 2) Different disassembly control method"
"CN113975546A","Syringe Body and Syringe","2022-01-28 (Pub)","Existing syringes with separable injection heads have inadequate end cap engagement. End cap can be easily disengaged creating safety risk during high-pressure injection.","Device","A: Syringe body for injection head assembly; B: Separable injection head body and end cap; C: Outer shell and internal pusher; D: Distal opening for locking; E-F: Position-dependent constraint","Outer shell diameter contacts end cap when unlocked preventing separation; radial gap forms at locked position allowing cap removal","High","1) Eliminate sequential dependency; 2) Permanent end cap replacement"
"CN113975545B","Injection Head Assembly","2023-10-27","Existing injection heads allow end cap removal before proper locking onto injector body. Creates severe safety hazard: injection head may be ejected during high-pressure injection.","Device","A: Injection head main body with cavity and micropores; B: Piston rod component; C: End cap; D: Position-dependent constraint mechanism (blocks/allows based on position)","Injector body acts as active constraint element preventing end cap deformation until locked position; state-dependent mechanical constraint","High","1) Eliminate removable cap entirely; 2) Constraint source not from injector body"
"CN115337503B","Needleless Injector","2023-11-10","Prior art needleless injectors require tedious multi-step operations: install drug tube, extract medicine using needle, separate from vial, then inject. Problematic in emergencies.","Device","A: Drug storage component with pre-filled chamber; B: Injection component with piston assembly and micropore; C: Safety device between chambers; D: Sequential actuation component","Sequential two-stage actuation: operating device first transfers drug to injection chamber, then triggers piston movement at predetermined position","High","1) Eliminate pre-filled configuration; 2) Simultaneous rather than sequential actuation"
"CN115429974A","Needleless Injector","2022-12-06 (Pub)","During pre-injection pressurization, piston pushrod tends to shift or displace prematurely, preventing proper pressurization and making injection impossible.","Device","A: Injection component with chamber and micropore; B: Piston assembly movable between first/second positions; C: Position-dependent locking device with auto-unlock at second position","Automatic position-dependent locking during charging stroke; precise release when maximum displacement reached allowing rapid injection","Medium","1) Eliminate automatic unlocking; 2) Eliminate distinct position-based locking"
"CN119607325A","Injection Head Assembly","2025-03-14 (Pub)","Existing injection caps are difficult to install correctly due to small size and complex structure. Users frequently fail to align cap properly with injection head.","Device","A: Injection head with base, main body, cavity, micropores, first guiding component; B: Injection cap with opening and second guiding component; C: Cooperative guiding relationship","Dual guiding rib system provides bi-directional rotational guidance regardless of initial installation angle; enables blind installation","Medium","1) Eliminate need for predetermined orientation; 2) External visual/tactile alignment only"
"CN115463288B","Needleless Injector","2024-08-16","Conventional needleless injectors require users to pull piston away when loading medicine, then push toward injection head when injecting. Two-direction operation is cumbersome.","Device","A: Injection assembly with chamber and microholes; B: Piston assembly with passage; C: Actuation assembly with operating device; D: Transmission device for motion direction conversion","Transmission device converts unidirectional forward user input into backward piston retraction; single direction for both preparation and injection","High","1) Conventional sequential bidirectional operation; 2) Non-mechanical actuation for piston"
"CN115463289B","Disposable Needleless Injector","2024-04-02","Conventional needleless injectors require users to draw medicine from external vials.

"CN119633206A","Piston Rod for Needle-Free Injector","2025-03-14 (Pub)","Medicine difficult to draw into drug tube cavity; during injection, medicine easily backflows from drug tube back to internal storage container. No precise flow direction control.","Device","A: Rod portion extending axially; B: Piston portion distally connected to rod; C: Uni-directional seal structure with open state (aspiration) and sealed state (injection)","Pressure-responsive seal automatically opens during aspiration allowing medicine entry; seals during injection preventing backflow via conical surface contact","High","1) Eliminate internal storage container; 2) Constant full-flow pathway with no seal"
